Attack Prevented:
1. Attacker registers victim@gmail.com (unverified)
2. Real victim uses "Sign in with Google"
3. WITHOUT protection → auto-link → attacker hijacks account ❌
4. WITH protection → REJECT unverified link → account safe ✅
```

Implementation:
```typescript
if (existingUser && !existingUser.emailVerified) {
  return false; // REJECT linking
}

#### Architecture Decision: Start Integrated, Extract Later

**Decision Made:** Option A - Build affiliate platform integrated within main SaaS codebase

**Rationale:**
- Faster time to market (3 months vs 5-6 months for separate systems)
- Validate both product and affiliate model before architectural commitment
- Learn real requirements from usage patterns
- Extraction is proven pattern (Amazon, Netflix, Uber all did this)
- Reduces complexity during MVP phase

**Future Consideration:** If affiliate platform scales significantly (>1000 affiliates), consider extraction to separate service using established patterns and real usage data.

#### Key Implementation Details:

**Scope:** 2-sided marketplace platform with three distinct user types
- **Side 1:** Affiliates (self-service portal with registration, dashboard, reports)
- **Side 2:** End Users (checkout with optional discount codes)
- **Platform Operator:** Admin (affiliate management + 4 BI reports)

**Database Changes:**
- 3 new models: Affiliate (27 fields), AffiliateCode (13 fields), Commission (12 fields)
- 4 new enums: PaymentMethod, AffiliateStatus, CodeStatus, CommissionStatus
- 1 modified model: Subscription (added affiliateCodeId nullable foreign key)

**API Surface:**
- 30+ new endpoints across affiliate portal, admin panel, and checkout integration
- Separate authentication system using AFFILIATE_JWT_SECRET
- All endpoints documented in OpenAPI spec

**Automation:**
- Monthly code distribution (1st of month, 00:00 UTC via Vercel Cron)
- Monthly code expiry (last day of month, 23:59 UTC)
- 8 email notification types (registration, welcome, code used, payment, etc.)

**Security:**
- Cryptographically secure code generation (crypto.randomBytes)
- Separate JWT authentication (no shared sessions)
- Code validation (ACTIVE, not expired, not used)
- Commission creation only via Stripe webhook (prevents fraud)
- Payment data encryption at rest

**Time Investment:**
- Documentation & Design: ~6 hours (Phase 1)
- Implementation: ~120 hours (Part 17 in Phase 3)
- Total: ~126 hours for complete affiliate platform

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (Design & Documentation Phase)

**Next Steps:**
- Implement Part 17 after completing Parts 1-16 (recommended before scaling)
- Week 10 timeline: Just before Part 18 begins
- Can be implemented earlier if affiliate marketing is prioritized

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_minimax_api_key_here"

# Stripe (for later)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
```

#### 3.3: Create Prisma Schema (30 minutes)

**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

**Use Aider to create schema from Part 2 requirements:**
```bash
py -3.11 -m aider --model anthropic/MiniMax-M2

# Command to Aider:
Create prisma/schema.prisma following Part 2 from v5_part_b.md.

---

## 📊 PHASE 2 COMPLETION CRITERIA

**When Phase 2 is complete, you'll have:**
- ✅ Next.js 15 project created
- ✅ TypeScript types generated from OpenAPI specs
- ✅ Prisma schema created and migrated
- ✅ Database connection working
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ Postman collections imported and ready
- ✅ Foundation verified and working

**Ready for Phase 3:** ✅ Start autonomous building with Aider!

**Documentation:** `docs/v7/v7_phase_2_foundation.md`

---

## 📅 PHASE 3: Autonomous Building with Aider (38 hours) ⏳ NOT STARTED

**Objective:** Use Aider with MiniMax M2 to build all 170+ files autonomously.

**Timeline:** Weeks 3-10

**Your Role:** Monitor progress, handle escalations, test as you build.

**Aider's Role:** Read requirements, generate code, validate, commit.

---

### 🔄 TWO LEVELS OF VALIDATION (Critical to Understand!)

Phase 3 uses **TWO different types of validation** at **TWO different scales**:

#### 1️⃣ FILE-LEVEL VALIDATION (Automated, Continuous)

**Tool:** Claude Code (built into Aider)
**Frequency:** After each file or small batch of files
**Purpose:** Check code quality, standards compliance, type safety
**Automated:** Yes - happens automatically

**The Process:**
```
Aider builds: app/api/auth/signup/route.ts
    ↓
Claude Code validates: Check TypeScript types, patterns, standards
    ↓
Decision:
  ✅ APPROVE → Commit → Next file
  🔧 FIX → Aider fixes → Claude Code re-validates → Commit
  🚨 ESCALATE → Ask you → You decide → Continue
```

**What it catches:**
- ✅ Syntax errors, type errors
- ✅ Code pattern violations
- ✅ Missing error handling
- ✅ Inconsistencies with policies
- ❌ **CANNOT** test if API actually works end-to-end

---

#### 2️⃣ PART-LEVEL VALIDATION (Manual, Milestone-Based)

**Tool:** Postman API Testing
**Frequency:** After completing an entire Part (e.g., all 18 Auth files)
**Purpose:** Verify APIs actually work end-to-end
**Automated:** No - you run these tests manually

**The Process:**
```
Aider completes ALL files in Part 5 (Authentication)
  ├─ route.ts (Claude validated ✅)
  ├─ schema.ts (Claude validated ✅)
  ├─ service.ts (Claude validated ✅)
  └─ All 18 auth files built and committed
    ↓
🧪 NOW YOU USE POSTMAN
    ↓
Open Postman → Run "Scenario 1: User Registration & Auth"
    ↓
Test POST /api/auth/signup
Test POST /api/auth/login
Test GET /api/auth/profile
    ↓
Decision:
  ✅ All tests pass → Move to Part 6
  ❌ Some tests fail → Tell Aider to fix → Re-test
```

**What it catches:**
- ✅ Actual HTTP requests/responses work
- ✅ Database operations function correctly
- ✅ Authentication flows are secure
- ✅ APIs match OpenAPI specifications
- ✅ Tier restrictions are enforced
- ❌ Too slow to run after every single file

---

#### 📊 VALIDATION COMPARISON

| Aspect | Claude Code (File-Level) | Postman (Part-Level) |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **When** | After each file | After Parts 5, 7, 11, 12 |
| **Tool** | Claude Code (automated) | Postman (manual) |
| **Speed** | Fast (seconds) | Slower (30 min per part) |
| **What** | Code quality, types | API functionality |
| **Who** | Aider (automatic) | You (manual testing) |
| **Frequency** | 170+ times | 4 times in Phase 3 |

---

#### ⏱️ TIME BREAKDOWN

**Total Phase 3 Time:** 38 hours

**Aider's Autonomous Work:** ~36 hours (96%)
- Building 170+ files
- Claude Code validation after each file
- Auto-fixes and commits
- Progress reporting

**Your Manual Work:** ~2-3 hours (4%)
- Postman testing: ~2 hours (4 sessions × 30 min)
- Handling escalations: ~30-60 min (if any occur)

**Result: 96% autonomous, 4% human oversight**

This is why V7 is so efficient - you only intervene at strategic milestones!

---

#### 🔧 HOW OPENAPI-GENERATED TYPES FIT IN

**Understanding the Connection:**

The OpenAPI scripts create the **foundation** that makes all three validation levels work together seamlessly.

```

**Why This Matters:**

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - OpenAPI specs define your API contract
   - Scripts generate TypeScript types from specs
   - Aider builds code using those types
   - Postman tests against the same specs
   - **Everyone uses the same contract!**

2. **Type Safety Throughout**
   - Aider can't use wrong types (TypeScript enforces)
   - Claude Code validates types match spec
   - Postman verifies runtime behavior matches spec

3. **No Manual Type Definitions**
   - Without scripts: Aider guesses types (error-prone)
   - With scripts: Types auto-generated (always correct)

**When to Re-run Scripts:**

```bash
# Only re-run if OpenAPI spec changes during Phase 3

# Example: Aider discovers missing field in spec
Aider: "The Alert model needs a 'priority' field, but it's not in the OpenAPI spec"

You: Edit docs/trading_alerts_openapi.yaml (add priority field)
You: sh scripts/openapi/generate-nextjs-types.sh (regenerate types)
Aider: "Thanks! Now continuing with updated types..."
```

**Summary:**
- **OpenAPI scripts run ONCE** in Phase 2 Step 2 (or auto-run via GitHub Actions)
- **Aider uses generated types** in all 170+ files during Phase 3
- **Claude Code validates** types match during Phase 3
- **Postman tests** APIs match specs during Phase 3
- **Re-run only if specs change** (automated via GitHub Actions!)

#### 📊 AUTOMATION SUMMARY TABLE

| Step | Task | Local | GitHub Actions | Who/What | Manual Effort |
|------|------|-------|----------------|----------|---------------|
| **(A)** | Create OpenAPI docs | ✅ | ❌ | YOU (one-time) | 100% (done!) |
| **(B)** | Generate types | 📝 Optional | ✅ **AUTO** | GitHub Actions | 0% 🎉 |
| **(C)** | Aider builds files | ✅ Required | ❌ | YOU + Aider | 4% (escalations) |
| **(D)** | Claude validates | ✅ Auto | ❌ | Aider (auto) | 0% 🎉 |
| **(E)** | Commit files | ✅ | ❌ | YOU (push) | 1% (review + push) |
| **(F)** | API testing | 📝 Optional | ✅ **AUTO** | GitHub Actions | 0% 🎉 |

**Legend:**
- ✅ = Available
- ❌ = Not available
- 📝 = Optional (can do if needed)
- **AUTO** = Fully automated!

---

#### 🎯 THE REAL AUTOMATION BREAKDOWN

**Phase 3 Building (38 hours):**

**What YOU Do (Local):**
- Run Aider: `py -3.11 -m aider --model anthropic/MiniMax-M2` (1 command)
- Tell Aider: "Build Part 5: Authentication" (1 command per Part)
- Handle escalations: When Aider asks for help (~4% of time)
- Review and push: `git push` after each Part (1 command per Part)

**What HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY:**

1. **While Aider Works (Local):**
   - Reads 170+ files autonomously ✅
   - Generates code for 170+ files ✅
   - Claude Code validates each file ✅
   - Auto-fixes issues ✅
   - Auto-commits approved files ✅
   - Progress reports ✅

2. **After You Push (GitHub Actions):**
   - Type generation (if OpenAPI changed) ✅
   - TypeScript compilation ✅
   - Linting checks ✅
   - OpenAPI validation ✅
   - API testing via Newman ✅
   - Test report generation ✅
   - Notifications on failures ✅

---

#### 💡 KEY INSIGHT: Semi-Autonomous vs Fully Autonomous

**Semi-Autonomous (Current Setup):**
- ✅ Aider builds autonomously (96% of time)
- ✅ Types auto-generate (100%)
- ✅ Tests auto-run (100%)
- 🔴 You monitor Aider locally (4% of time)
- 🔴 You push code manually

**Why not 100% autonomous?**
- Aider needs human judgment for:
  - Architectural decisions
  - Breaking changes
  - Ambiguous requirements
  - Security-sensitive code
  - Cross-part dependencies

**This is GOOD for beginners:**
- ✅ You learn as you watch Aider work
- ✅ You approve before production
- ✅ You understand the codebase
- ✅ You control the pace

---

#### ⚙️ WHAT'S FULLY AUTOMATED (Set and Forget)

After Phase 2 setup, these run automatically forever:

1. **OpenAPI Type Sync** (.github/workflows/openapi-sync.yml)
   - Edit: `docs/trading_alerts_openapi.yaml`
   - Push to GitHub
   - ⚡ Types regenerate automatically
   - ⚡ Auto-committed and pushed
   - No manual `sh generate-nextjs-types.sh` needed!

2. **API Testing** (.github/workflows/api-tests.yml)
   - Edit any API route file
   - Push to GitHub
   - ⚡ Tests run automatically
   - ⚡ Report generated
   - ⚡ Email if tests fail
   - No manual Postman clicking needed!

3. **CI/CD Checks** (other workflows)
   - TypeScript checks
   - Linting
   - Build validation
   - All automatic on every push!

---

#### 📈 TIME SAVINGS WITH AUTOMATION

**Without GitHub Actions Automation:**
```
Every OpenAPI change:
- Manual: sh generate-nextjs-types.sh (2 min)
- Manual: sh generate-flask-types.sh (2 min)
- Manual: Open Postman (1 min)
- Manual: Run 20 tests (15 min)
- Manual: Document results (5 min)
Total per change: 25 minutes × 10 changes = 4.2 hours 😫
```

**With GitHub Actions Automation:**
```
Every OpenAPI change:
- Edit YAML file (2 min)
- Push to GitHub (10 sec)
- ☕ Get coffee while CI runs (0 min active work)
- Review automated report (2 min)
Total per change: 4 minutes × 10 changes = 40 minutes! 🎉

Time saved: 3.3 hours per 10 changes! ⚡
```

### HOW PHASE 3 WORKS (For Beginners)

**Think of Aider as your autonomous developer:**

1. **You give a command:** "Build Part 5: Authentication"
2. **Aider reads requirements:** From v5_part_e.md
3. **Aider generates code:** Following your policies
4. **Aider validates:** Using Claude Code
5. **Aider decides:**
   - ✅ Auto-approve and commit (if policies met)
   - 🔧 Auto-fix issues (if fixable)
   - ⚠️ Escalate to you (if uncertain)
6. **You test:** Test the endpoints in Postman
7. **Repeat:** Move to next part

**Typical Session:**
- Aider builds 3 files → Reports progress
- Aider builds 3 more files → Reports progress
- Aider encounters issue → Escalates to you
- You decide → Aider continues
- Part complete → You test in Postman
- Move to next part

---

### PHASE 3 BUILD ORDER (16 Parts)

Build in this order for proper dependencies:

---

- [ ] Take a break! 🎉 Foundation complete!

---

### PART 5: Authentication System (Week 4, 6 hours)

**What:** User authentication, registration, login, session management.

**Files:** 18 files

**Command:**
```bash
py -3.11 -m aider --model anthropic/MiniMax-M2

Build Part 5: Authentication from v5_part_e.md

Follow the workflow:
1. Read requirements
2. Use patterns from 05-coding-patterns.md
3. Reference seed-code/saas-starter/ for NextAuth patterns
4. Build all 18 files
5. Notify me every 3 files
```

**Aider will build:**
- [ ] Auth pages (login, register, forgot-password, etc.)
- [ ] API routes (NextAuth, registration, verification)
- [ ] Auth components (forms, social auth buttons)
- [ ] Auth utilities (auth-options, session, permissions)
- [ ] Middleware for protected routes

**Testing with Postman (MILESTONE 1.3 IN USE!):**

After Aider completes Part 5:

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`

2. Open Postman → "Trading Alerts API" collection

3. **Test Authentication (Scenario 1):**

   📖 **Follow:** `postman/TESTING-GUIDE.md` → Scenario 1

   - [ ] Test: POST /api/auth/signup
     - Body: `{ "email": "test@example.com", "password": "SecurePass123!", "name": "Test User" }`
     - Expected: 201 Created, user object, token returned
     - **Copy the token!**

   - [ ] Test: POST /api/auth/login
     - Body: `{ "email": "test@example.com", "password": "SecurePass123!" }`
     - Expected: 200 OK, token returned

   - [ ] Test: GET /api/users/profile

     - Expected: 200 OK, user profile returned

   - [ ] Test: Unauthorized access
     - Remove Authorization header
     - Expected: 401 Unauthorized

4. **Document Results:**
   - [ ] All auth endpoints working? ✅ / ❌
   - [ ] JWT tokens generated? ✅ / ❌
   - [ ] Session management working? ✅ / ❌
   - [ ] Found any bugs? (Document in PROGRESS.md)

**If tests fail:**
1. Check Aider's commits for the file with issues
2. Ask Aider to fix: "The POST /api/auth/login endpoint returns 500 error. Please investigate and fix."
3. Retest after fix

**Estimated Time:**
- Aider builds: 5 hours
- Your testing: 1 hour
