ANSWER to 15. OPEN QUESTIONS & DECISIONS NEEDED

Before implementation, please decide:

1. **Code Format Preference:**
   - Option A: Auto-generated (e.g., TRADE8A3B2C1D) ---> Yes to this (code format must be full random with >12 characters e.g. SxTYo25#1dpgiNguD because code would be one-time use; once expired, user must contact affiliates or search for new code from social media that affiliates posted. 
   - Option B: Admin-provided custom (e.g., SAVE20PRO)
   - Option C: Hybrid (prefix + random, e.g., AFFILIATE-8A3B2C1D)

2. **Maximum Discount:**
   - Current design: 50% max ---> Yes to this
   - Adjust if needed (e.g., 30% max for safety)

3. **Commission Payment Method:**

   - Current design: Manual (PayPal/Bank Transfer) ---> Yes to this
   - Future: Automated Stripe payouts?

4. **Affiliate Self-Service:**
   - MVP: Admin manages everything ---> No to this (This is not transparent and result in low trust in business engagement by affiliates)
   - Future: Let affiliates log in to view earnings? ---> affiliates should have their own log in page to view their 

(1) Code inventory report :

Here is logic of code inventory report 

(1.0) opening codes balance, at beginning of current month = this codes balance came from closing codes balance at the end of previous month  
(1.1) discount codes received from Admin during current month (codes received) (as Admin allocates codes to all individual affiliates) 
(1.2) codes used by free tier user to upgrade to pro plan during current month (codes used)
(1.3) codes expired  
(1.4) codes cancelled by Admin during current month (code cancelled) (as Admin may want to discontinue with this affiliate or as marketing plan was changed) 
(1.5) closing codes balance, at end of current month = (1.0) + (1.1) - (1.2) - (1.3) - (1.4)

6 Columns ---> No. | Cancelled time and date | Codes Numbers | %Discount (e.g. 20% discount, 25% discount, etc) | Affiliate ID who own this code
| Reason for Cancellation (specified by admin)

At inception of being Affiliates (at a time of affiliate account is created) ---> 15 Codes are given to the each affiliate account.

Useful life of code = last until end of month (all codes issued during current month will be expired at the end of month - at time of xx:xx:xx (you may specify this standard time for expiration))

New code is issued at beginning of the month at time xx:xx:xx (you may specify this standard time for new code distribution to all affiliates)

How many new codes should be given to each different affiliates ? ---> answer = 15 codes ; in case 15 codes are used up before end of month, affiliate may contact admin and ask for more codes, admin may generate more codes and specifically distribute to that affiliate (must have code generation and distribution page for admin to generate and distribute code to affiliate using affiliate ID as identification for code distribution).


5. **Code Usage Limits:**

   - Current design: Unlimited uses per code ---> Yes to this
   - Future: Max uses per code? (e.g., first 100 users)

6. **Recurring Commissions:**

   - Current design: One-time commission on signup ---> Yes to this (I do not agree with Recurring commission on renewal as code is used just one-time, if user want to renew the PRO Plan, user must contact affiliate (maybe the one who used to give code to the user or new one who has never provide code to user). Therefore this would encourage competition among affiliates in reaching out potential users.
   - Future: Recurring commissions on renewals? ---> I disagree this!

=================================================================

Please redesign the SaaS system to reflect all requirements above (prefer to use Next.js 15 backend engine and postgreSQL for SaaS system design)

You may first study ui-frontend-user-journey/saas-user-journey-updated.md + 3 mermaid diagrams in ui-frontend-user-journey/mermaid-diagrams folder 

then 

incorporate your previously proposed plan + my business plan above into saas-user-journey-updated.md 

then

(1) update docs/AFFILIATE-MARKETING-DESIGN.md 
(2) update docs/AFFILIATE-MARKETING-INTEGRATION-CHECKLIST.md 
(3) create a complete updated version of saas-user-journey-updated.md 
(4) update all mermaid diagrams in the ui-frontend-user-journey/mermaid-diagrams folder (you may create new/add mermaid diagrams if deem appropriate)

Remark : I am not just doing business as a SaaS provider but doing business as SaaS distributor as well so affilate marketing plan is seriously deemed as core business as well.
