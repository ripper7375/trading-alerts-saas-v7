## 📌 When Aider Asks for Clarification

```
Follow the build order specification exactly as written in part-0X-[name].md.

If something is ambiguous:
1. Check the implementation guide (v5_part_[letter].md)
2. Check the coding patterns (05-coding-patterns-compress.md)
3. If still unclear, escalate to me with specific question

Proceed with your best interpretation based on policies.
```

---

## 📌 When Aider Escalates

**Option 1: Approve**
```
Approved. Proceed with this implementation.
```

**Option 2: Changes Needed**
```
Make this change: [specific instruction]. Then proceed.
```

**Option 3: Major Issue**
```
Stop. Let me review the requirements. [Provide guidance]
```

---

## 📌 Resuming After Break

```
Resume Part [X] from where we left off.

Last completed: File [N]/[Total]
Next: File [N+1]/[Total]: [filename]

Continue following the build order.
```

---

## 📌 Verification After Part Complete

```
Run verification tests for Part [X]:

1. TypeScript: npx tsc --noEmit
2. Linting: pnpm lint
3. Build: pnpm build (if applicable)
4. Manual checks as specified in part-0X-[name].md

Report results and any issues found.
```

---

## 📌 If Something Goes Wrong

```
Stop current work.

Issue: [describe the problem]

Check these:
1. Are all dependencies met? (previous parts complete?)
2. Does the code follow the correct pattern?
3. Does it validate against policies?

Analyze the issue and provide a fix proposal.
If you cannot fix it, escalate with detailed explanation.
```

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL REMINDERS

### **✅ ALWAYS DO:**
- Use `/read-only` for build order files (NOT `/add`)
- Load implementation guides with `/read-only`
- Let Aider complete each file without interruption
- Trust the validation process
- Check progress reports

### **❌ NEVER DO:**
- Use `/add` for build orders (they become editable!)
- Interrupt Aider mid-file
- Skip verification tests
- Override build order without reason
- Panic when Aider escalates (it's designed to escalate)

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: "Cannot find v5_part_X.md"**

**Symptoms:**
- Aider says it cannot find an implementation guide
- Error: "File not found: docs/implementation-guides/v5_part_k.md"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if all 18 guides exist
cd docs/implementation-guides
ls -1 v5_part_{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,r,s}.md | wc -l
# Should return: 18

# If any are missing, check the audit report
# All guides were created on 2025-11-21 and should exist
```

**All 18 guides now exist:**
- Parts 1-10: v5_part_a.md through v5_part_j.md ✅
- Parts 11-16: v5_part_k.md through v5_part_p.md ✅
- Part 17: v5_part_r.md ✅
- Part 18: v5_part_s.md ✅

### **Issue: Token limit exceeded**

**Solution:**
```bash
# Drop unused files
/drop docs/build-orders/part-XX-previous.md
/drop docs/implementation-guides/v5_part_previous.md

# Clear conversation if needed
/clear
```

### **Issue: Aider doesn't load policy files**

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify .aider.conf.yml exists in project root
ls -la .aider.conf.yml

# Restart Aider to reload configuration
# Exit and start again with start-aider-anthropic.bat
```

---

## 📊 Token Usage Guidelines

| Phase | Expected Tokens | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Base Load | 129k | Always loaded |
| + Part Files | +6-15k | Varies by part |
| + Conversation | Variable | Grows over time |
| **Safe Limit** | 180k | Stay below this |
| **Max Limit** | 204k | Context overflow |

**If approaching 180k tokens:**
- Drop previous part files
- Clear conversation: `/clear`
- Restart Aider if needed

**Document Version:** 2.0 (Corrected)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-21
