# Affiliate Discount Code Business Logic Correction

**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Issue:** Critical business logic error in affiliate discount code implementation
**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive correction of the affiliate discount code business logic from an **incorrect permanent/lifetime discount model** to the **correct one-time monthly promo code model**.

### The Problem

The system documentation incorrectly described discount codes as providing:
- ❌ **Permanent/lifetime discounts** (once applied, discount lasts forever)
- ❌ Users pay $23.20/month indefinitely after using one code
- ❌ No need to re-enter codes on renewal

### The Solution

Corrected all documentation to reflect the proper business model:
- ✅ **One-time use, non-permanent monthly promo codes**
- ✅ Each code provides discount for ONE payment only
- ✅ At renewal, users pay full price ($29.00) unless they enter a NEW code
- ✅ Users must find fresh codes on social media monthly from affiliates

---

## 🎯 Business Rationale

The correct one-time monthly code model:

1. **Drives Affiliate Engagement:** Affiliates must continuously post codes on social media
2. **Encourages Social Media Activity:** Creates ongoing social media presence and engagement
3. **Creates Competition:** Affiliates compete to distribute codes, increasing reach
4. **Sustainable Economics:** Prevents indefinite 20% discounts from single code use
5. **User Engagement:** Encourages users to follow and engage with affiliates monthly

## ✅ Files Verified (No Changes Needed)

### 1. **ARCHITECTURE.md**
- ✅ No mentions of permanent/lifetime discounts
- ✅ Database schema is already correct

### 2. **docs/AFFILIATE-MARKETING-DESIGN.md**
- ✅ Database schema correctly implements one-time use:
  ```prisma
  model AffiliateCode {
    usedBy    String?   // User ID who redeemed (ONE TIME)
    usedAt    DateTime? // When redeemed
    status    CodeStatus @default(ACTIVE)
  }

  enum CodeStatus {
    ACTIVE   // Available for use
    USED     // Redeemed by user (ONE TIME)
    EXPIRED  // Passed expiry date
    CANCELLED
  }
  ```
- ✅ Business logic correctly specified

### 3. **docs/policies/** files
- ✅ 04-escalation-triggers.md contains "permanent" only in generic architectural decision context
- ✅ No affiliate discount-related policy violations found

### 4. **ui-frontend-user-journey/saas-user-journey-updated.md**
- ✅ Already shows correct one-time discount code entry during checkout
- ✅ No permanent discount language found

## 📌 Code Lifecycle Specification

For reference, the correct affiliate code lifecycle:

```
AFFILIATE REGISTRATION
    ↓
15 codes generated → ACTIVE status
    ↓
MONTHLY (automated)
    ↓
15 new codes generated → ACTIVE status
Previous month's codes → EXPIRED status
    ↓
USER REDEEMS CODE
    ↓
Code status: ACTIVE → USED
usedBy: [user_id]
usedAt: [timestamp]
    ↓
DISCOUNT APPLIED TO ONE PAYMENT
    ↓
NEXT RENEWAL
    ↓
Full price: $29.00 (no discount)
User must enter NEW code for discount
```

---

## 🎯 Commission Formula

Reminder of correct commission calculation:

```
Base Case (No Discount):
$29.00 × 20% = $5.80 commission to affiliate

With Discount (User uses affiliate code):
Step 1: Calculate discounted price
  $29.00 × (100% - 20%) = $29.00 × 0.80 = $23.20

Step 2: Calculate affiliate commission
  $23.20 × 20% = $4.64 commission to affiliate

Effect: Affiliate earns $4.64 per referred user per month (when code is used)
```
