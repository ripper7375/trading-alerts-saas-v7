## 1. Business Context

### Problem Statement

**Current Situation:**

- Stripe (current payment provider) requires international credit/debit cards
- Many users in emerging markets (India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, South Africa, Turkey) don't have international cards
- These users cannot access PRO features, limiting market penetration

**Solution:**

- Integrate dLocal payment gateway for emerging markets
- Support local payment methods (UPI, Paytm, JazzCash, GoPay, etc.)
- Maintain existing Stripe integration for other markets

**Expected Impact:**

- Expand addressable market to 8+ countries
- Enable 50-70% of emerging market users to subscribe (who previously couldn't)
- No changes to existing Stripe users

## 2. Key Differences: dLocal vs Stripe

| Feature                | Stripe              | dLocal                        | Impact                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Auto-Renewal**       | ✅ Automatic        | ❌ Manual renewal required    | We must send renewal reminders        |
| **Free Trial**         | ✅ 7 days           | ❌ None                       | dLocal users start paying immediately |
| **Subscription Plans** | Monthly ($29)       | 3-day ($1.99) + Monthly ($29) | New 3-day plan exclusive to dLocal    |
| **Discount Codes**     | ✅ All plans        | ❌ Monthly only               | 3-day plan ineligible for discounts   |
| **Renewal Process**    | Stripe auto-charges | User must manually renew      | Cron jobs handle expiry/downgrades    |
| **Notifications**      | Stripe manages      | We send all emails            | More notification templates needed    |

### 9.3 End-to-End Tests (Manual)

**Test Scenario 1: India - UPI Payment (Monthly)**

1. User selects India → Sees UPI, Paytm, PhonePe, Card
2. Selects Monthly plan → Sees ₹2,407/month
3. Selects UPI payment method
4. Enters discount code "WELCOME20" → Price: ₹1,926 (20% off)
5. Clicks "Pay Now" → Redirected to dLocal UPI page

7. Webhook fires → Subscription created (ACTIVE)
8. User tier: FREE → PRO
9. Email received: "Payment Successful"
10. Dashboard shows PRO features unlocked

**Expected:** ✅ All steps pass

**Test Scenario 2: Pakistan - 3-Day Plan (No Discount)**

1. User selects Pakistan → Sees JazzCash, Easypaisa, Card
2. Selects 3-Day plan → Sees Rs 552/3 days
3. Discount code input hidden (3-day plan restriction)
4. Selects JazzCash payment method
5. Completes payment
6. PRO access for 3 days
7. Day 3: Renewal reminder email sent
8. Day 4: Subscription expires → Downgraded to FREE

**Expected:** ✅ All steps pass

**Test Scenario 3: Cron Job Testing**

3. Verify renewal reminder email sent
4. Verify `renewalReminderSent = true` in database
5. Fast-forward time to expiresAt
6. Run cron: `GET /api/cron/downgrade-expired-subscriptions`
7. Verify subscription status = EXPIRED
