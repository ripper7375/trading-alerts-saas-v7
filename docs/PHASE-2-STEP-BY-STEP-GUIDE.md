## 🎯 OVERVIEW & PREPARATION

### What You'll Accomplish in Phase 2

✅ **Automation Infrastructure** - 5 GitHub Actions workflows (including 2 pre-built!)
✅ **Security Setup** - GitHub secrets for sensitive credentials
✅ **Database Deployment** - Railway PostgreSQL live in Week 2 (prevents migration hell!)
✅ **Workflow Understanding** - Prisma database migrations
✅ **Container Setup** - Docker configuration for Flask service
✅ **Testing Framework** - Jest ready for Phase 3

### Why This Matters

**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** By deploying the database in **Week 2** (not Week 10!), you'll:
- Test database changes on Railway throughout Phase 3
- Discover problems early when they're easy to fix
- Avoid "migration hell" at the end when everything depends on the database

### Before You Start

**Prerequisites Check:**
- ✅ Phase 1 complete (all 18 build-order files verified)
- ✅ Python 3.11 installed
- ✅ Aider installed (`pip install aider-chat`)
- ✅ MiniMax M2 API key set in environment variables
- ✅ Git configured and repository ready
- ✅ GitHub account with access to your repository

**Tools You'll Need:**
- Terminal/Command Prompt
- Web browser (for GitHub, Railway)
- Text editor (for reviewing files Aider creates)
- Claude Chat (for screenshot help when stuck)

---

## 🔨 MILESTONE 2.1: GitHub Actions Setup (2 hours)

### Overview
Set up automated CI/CD workflows that run on every code push to ensure quality and catch errors early.

### What You'll Create
1. ✅ Next.js CI workflow (build, type-check, lint)
2. ✅ Flask CI workflow (build, lint, type-check)
3. ✅ OpenAPI validation workflow (spec validation)
4. ✅ OpenAPI auto-sync workflow (**PRE-BUILT - already exists!**)
5. ✅ API auto-testing workflow (**PRE-BUILT - already exists!**)

---

### STEP 1: Start Aider (2 minutes)

**Open Terminal:**

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /home/user/trading-alerts-saas-v7

# Start Aider with MiniMax M2
py -3.11 -m aider --model anthropic/MiniMax-M2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Aider v0.x.x
Model: anthropic/MiniMax-M2
Git repo: trading-alerts-saas-v7
Files loaded:
  ✓ docs/policies/00-tier-specifications.md
  ✓ docs/policies/01-approval-policies.md
  ... (all policy files load)
  ✓ PROGRESS.md

Ready!
```

**If Stuck:** Take a screenshot of the error and ask Claude Chat: "I'm getting this error when starting Aider. What should I do?"

---

### STEP 2: Create Next.js CI Workflow (30 minutes)

**Copy and paste this EXACT prompt to Aider:**

```
Create .github/workflows/ci-nextjs.yml

Requirements:
- Trigger on push to main branch
- Trigger on pull requests
- Build Next.js 15 with Turbopack
- Validate docs/trading_alerts_openapi.yaml with swagger-cli
- Run TypeScript type checking (npx tsc --noEmit)
- Run ESLint (npm run lint)
- Use Node.js 18.x
- Cache npm dependencies for faster builds
- Follow GitHub Actions best practices from policies

Show me the complete workflow file for approval.
```

**What Happens:**
1. Aider reads your policies and requirements
2. Aider generates a complete GitHub Actions YAML file
3. Aider shows you the file content for review

**Review the Output:**
- Check file location: `.github/workflows/ci-nextjs.yml` ✓
- Check trigger events: `push` to main, `pull_request` ✓
- Check Node.js version: 18.x ✓
- Check steps: install, build, type-check, lint ✓

**Approve:**
Type in Aider: `Yes, create this file`

**Aider Will:**
- Create `.github/workflows/ci-nextjs.yml`
- Commit the file with a proper commit message

**Verify:**
```bash
cat .github/workflows/ci-nextjs.yml
```

**Expected:** A complete GitHub Actions workflow file (50-100 lines)

**If Stuck:** Screenshot the Aider output and ask Claude Chat: "Does this workflow look correct for Next.js 15?"

---

### STEP 3: Create Flask CI Workflow (30 minutes)

**Copy and paste this EXACT prompt to Aider:**

```
Create .github/workflows/ci-flask.yml

Requirements:
- Trigger on push to main branch
- Trigger on pull requests
- Build Flask application
- Validate docs/flask_mt5_openapi.yaml with swagger-cli
- Run Python linting with flake8
- Run Python type checking with mypy
- Use Python 3.11
- Cache pip dependencies
- Install requirements from mt5-service/requirements.txt
- Follow GitHub Actions best practices

Show me the complete workflow file for approval.
```

**Review the Output:**
- Check file location: `.github/workflows/ci-flask.yml` ✓
- Check Python version: 3.11 ✓
- Check steps: install, lint, type-check ✓
- Check requirements path: `mt5-service/requirements.txt` ✓

**Approve:**
Type in Aider: `Yes, create this file`

**Verify:**
```bash
cat .github/workflows/ci-flask.yml
```

---

### STEP 4: Create OpenAPI Validation Workflow (30 minutes)

**Copy and paste this EXACT prompt to Aider:**

```
Create .github/workflows/openapi-validation.yml

Requirements:
- Trigger on any change to *.yaml files in docs/ directory
- Validate docs/trading_alerts_openapi.yaml
- Validate docs/flask_mt5_openapi.yaml
- Validate docs/dlocal-openapi-endpoints.yaml
- Check for breaking changes in API specs
- Use swagger-cli for validation
- Report validation errors clearly in workflow output
- Fail the workflow if any spec is invalid

Show me the complete workflow file for approval.
```

**Review the Output:**
- Check trigger: `paths: ['docs/*.yaml']` ✓
- Check all 3 specs are validated ✓
- Check swagger-cli is used ✓

**Approve:**
Type in Aider: `Yes, create this file`

**Verify:**
```bash
cat .github/workflows/openapi-validation.yml
```

---

### STEP 5: Verify Pre-Built OpenAPI Auto-Sync Workflow (5 minutes)

**This workflow is ALREADY CREATED for you!** 🎉

**What it does automatically:**
- Detects changes to OpenAPI YAML files
- Validates OpenAPI specs
- Runs `scripts/generate-nextjs-types.sh` automatically
- Runs `scripts/generate-flask-types.sh` automatically
- Commits and pushes updated types to your branch
- **No human intervention needed!**

**Verify it exists:**
```bash
cat .github/workflows/openapi-sync.yml
```

**Expected:** A complete workflow file that auto-generates types

**Automation Win:** You'll NEVER need to manually run type generation scripts after Phase 2! Just update the YAML, push, and GitHub Actions handles the rest.

**Note:** If file doesn't exist, it will be created in the next section.

---

### STEP 6: Verify Pre-Built API Auto-Testing Workflow (5 minutes)

**This workflow is ALSO ALREADY CREATED for you!** 🎉

**What it does automatically:**
- Starts test database (PostgreSQL)
- Runs database migrations
- Starts Next.js dev server
- Runs all Postman collections via Newman CLI
- Generates HTML test reports
- Uploads reports to GitHub artifacts
- **No manual Postman testing needed in CI!**

**Verify it exists:**
```bash
cat .github/workflows/api-tests.yml
```

**Expected:** A complete Newman testing workflow

**Important Note:** This workflow activates AFTER Phase 3 Part 5 when you export Postman collections. For now, it will skip if no collections exist (that's normal!).

**How to activate later (after Phase 3 Part 5):**
1. Open Postman
2. Right-click "Trading Alerts API" collection
3. Export → Collection v2.1
4. Save as: `postman/trading-alerts-api.postman_collection.json`
5. Export environment as: `postman/environment.json`
6. Commit both files
7. Push → CI will now auto-test APIs! 🎉

---

### STEP 7: Push Workflows and Verify (30 minutes)

**Exit Aider:**
```
/exit
```

**Stage all workflow files:**
```bash
git add .github/workflows/
git status
```

**Expected output:**
```
Changes to be committed:
  new file:   .github/workflows/ci-nextjs.yml
  new file:   .github/workflows/ci-flask.yml
  new file:   .github/workflows/openapi-validation.yml
  (possibly) .github/workflows/openapi-sync.yml
  (possibly) .github/workflows/api-tests.yml
```

**Commit:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add CI/CD workflows (Next.js, Flask, OpenAPI validation, auto-sync, API tests)"
```

**Push to your branch:**
```bash
git push -u origin claude/phase-2-foundation-setup
```

**Verify on GitHub:**

1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Navigate to your repository
3. Click **"Actions"** tab (top menu)
4. You should see workflows running

**Expected Results:**

| Workflow | Status | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| OpenAPI Sync | ✅ Should pass | Validates OpenAPI specs |
| OpenAPI Validation | ✅ Should pass | Specs are valid |
| Next.js CI | ⚠️ May fail | Project doesn't exist yet - **NORMAL!** |
| Flask CI | ⚠️ May fail | Flask code doesn't exist yet - **NORMAL!** |
| API Tests | ⏭️ Skips | No Postman collections yet - **NORMAL!** |

**If Next.js/Flask workflows fail:** That's expected! The project code doesn't exist yet. They'll pass after Phase 3.

**If Stuck:** Take a screenshot of the GitHub Actions page and ask Claude Chat: "Are these workflow results normal for Phase 2?"

---

### ✅ Checkpoint: Milestone 2.1 Complete

You should now have:
- ✅ 5 GitHub Actions workflows created
- ✅ Workflows running automatically on push
- ✅ Automation foundation ready for Phase 3

**Time Spent:** ~2 hours
**Next:** Milestone 2.2 - GitHub Secrets Configuration

---

## 🔐 MILESTONE 2.2: GitHub Secrets Configuration (30 minutes)

### Overview
Store sensitive credentials securely in GitHub. **NEVER commit secrets to code!**

---

### STEP 1: Navigate to GitHub Secrets (5 minutes)

**In your web browser:**

1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Navigate to your repository: `ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-v7`
3. Click **"Settings"** tab (top menu)
4. In left sidebar, click **"Secrets and variables"**
5. Click **"Actions"**

**You should see:** "New repository secret" button (green)

**If Stuck:** Screenshot the Settings page and ask Claude Chat: "I can't find the Secrets section. Where is it?"

---

### STEP 2: Generate NextAuth Secret (5 minutes)

**In your terminal:**

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

**Expected output:** A long random string like:
```
abc123xyz789defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890==
```

**IMPORTANT:** Copy this output! You'll need it in the next step.

**Save it temporarily:** Paste into a text file for reference (delete after adding to GitHub)

**If you don't have openssl:** Use an online generator (search "random base64 generator") or ask Claude Chat for alternatives.

---

### STEP 3: Add GitHub Secrets (15 minutes)

**For EACH secret below, follow these steps:**

1. Click **"New repository secret"** (green button)
2. Enter the **Name** (exact case-sensitive match)
3. Enter the **Value**
4. Click **"Add secret"**

**Secrets to Add:**

| # | Name | Value | Where to Get It |
|---|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | [from Step 2] | The base64 string you just generated |
| 2 | `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://temp:temp@localhost/temp` | Temporary placeholder (will update in Milestone 2.3) |
| 3 | `MT5_API_KEY` | `temp-key-123` | Temporary placeholder (will update later) |
| 4 | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | [your MiniMax M2 key] | Your actual MiniMax M2 API key |
| 5 | `ANTHROPIC_API_BASE` | `https://api.minimaxi.com/v1` | MiniMax API endpoint |

**Important Notes:**
- SECRET NAMES are case-sensitive - use EXACT names above
- Values 2 and 3 are temporary - you'll update them later
- Value 4 should be your REAL MiniMax M2 API key
- Value 5 is always the same MiniMax endpoint

**After adding each secret, it will show in the list with:**
- ✅ Name visible
- ✅ Value hidden (shows as `•••••••`)
- ✅ "Updated X seconds ago"

---

### STEP 4: Verify Secrets (5 minutes)

**Check your secrets list:**

You should see exactly **5 secrets** listed:
1. ✅ NEXTAUTH_SECRET
2. ✅ DATABASE_URL
3. ✅ MT5_API_KEY
4. ✅ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
5. ✅ ANTHROPIC_API_BASE

**All values should be hidden** (showing dots: `•••••••`)

**If you made a mistake:**
- Click on the secret name
- Click "Update" to change the value
- Or "Remove" to delete and re-add

**If Stuck:** Screenshot the secrets list and ask Claude Chat: "Do these secrets look correct?"

---

### ✅ Checkpoint: Milestone 2.2 Complete

You should now have:
- ✅ All 5 GitHub secrets configured
- ✅ Values are hidden (secure)
- ✅ NextAuth secret is cryptographically random

**Security Win:** Secrets are now secure and never committed to code!

**Time Spent:** ~30 minutes
**Next:** Milestone 2.3 - Railway PostgreSQL Setup (**CRITICAL**)

---

## 🚂 MILESTONE 2.3: Railway PostgreSQL Setup (1.5 hours)

### Overview
Deploy your PostgreSQL database to Railway cloud **NOW** (Week 2, not Week 10!). This is the critical difference in V7 - test database deployment early to prevent migration hell later.

**Why This Matters:** Testing database changes on Railway throughout Phase 3 means you discover problems early when they're easy to fix!

---

### STEP 1: Create Railway Account (10 minutes)

**In your web browser:**

1. Go to **railway.app**
2. Click **"Login"** (top right)
3. Select **"Login with GitHub"**
4. Click **"Authorize Railway"** (green button)
5. Check your email for verification link
6. Click verification link

**You should see:** Railway dashboard with "New Project" button

**Free Tier Benefits:**
- $5 free credit (enough for development)
- 5GB PostgreSQL storage
- No credit card required initially

**If Stuck:** Screenshot the Railway page and ask Claude Chat: "I'm stuck at Railway signup. What should I do?"

---

### STEP 2: Create Railway Project (10 minutes)

**On Railway dashboard:**

1. Click **"New Project"** (purple button)
2. Select **"Provision PostgreSQL"**
3. **Project name:** `trading-alerts-saas-v7`
4. **Region:** Select the one closest to you:
   - US West (Oregon) - if you're in North America West
   - US East (Virginia) - if you're in North America East
   - Europe (Frankfurt) - if you're in Europe
   - Asia (Singapore) - if you're in Asia
5. Click **"Deploy"** (or it deploys automatically)

**Wait 2-3 minutes:** Railway is provisioning your PostgreSQL database

**You should see:**
- Database status: "Active" (green)
- Database icon with "PostgreSQL" label
- Deployment logs scrolling

**If deployment fails:** Screenshot the error and ask Claude Chat: "Railway deployment failed with this error. What should I do?"

---

### STEP 3: Get Database Connection URL (10 minutes)

**On Railway project page:**

1. Click on the **PostgreSQL** service card
2. Click **"Connect"** tab (top menu)
3. Look for **"DATABASE_URL"** section
4. Click the **"Copy"** icon next to the URL

**The URL looks like:**
```
postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@containers-us-west-XXX.railway.app:5432/railway
```

**IMPORTANT - Save this URL securely:**
1. Open a text editor
2. Paste the Railway URL
3. Save as `RAILWAY-CREDENTIALS.txt` (temporary, DON'T commit to git!)
4. You'll need this URL in the next steps

**Security Note:** This URL contains your database password - keep it private!

**Alternative view:** Under "Variables" tab, you'll see:
- PGHOST
- PGPORT
- PGUSER
- PGPASSWORD
- PGDATABASE

These combine to form DATABASE_URL.

---

### STEP 4: Test Connection Locally (15 minutes)

**This step verifies Railway database is accessible from your computer.**

**Create test file:**

```bash
# In your project root
cat > test-db-connection.js << 'EOF'
const { Client } = require('pg');

const connectionString = 'PASTE_YOUR_RAILWAY_URL_HERE';

const client = new Client({ connectionString });

console.log('🔄 Connecting to Railway PostgreSQL...');

client.connect()
  .then(() => {
    console.log('✅ Connected successfully to Railway PostgreSQL!');
    console.log('📊 Database:', client.database);
    console.log('🖥️  Host:', client.host);
    return client.end();
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('❌ Connection failed!');
    console.error('Error:', err.message);
    console.error('Code:', err.code);
  });
EOF
```

**Edit the file and replace `PASTE_YOUR_RAILWAY_URL_HERE` with your actual Railway URL:**

```bash
# Open in your editor
nano test-db-connection.js
# or
code test-db-connection.js
```

**Install pg library temporarily:**
```bash
npm install pg
```

**Run the test:**
```bash
node test-db-connection.js
```

**Expected Success Output:**
```
🔄 Connecting to Railway PostgreSQL...
✅ Connected successfully to Railway PostgreSQL!
📊 Database: railway
🖥️  Host: containers-us-west-XXX.railway.app
```

**If you see this:** ✅ SUCCESS! Your Railway database is accessible!

**Common Errors and Solutions:**

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `ENOTFOUND` | Wrong host | Double-check Railway URL is correct |
| `ECONNREFUSED` | Wrong port or firewall | Check if Railway service is "Active" |
| `password authentication failed` | Wrong password | Re-copy DATABASE_URL from Railway |
| `timeout` | Network issue | Check your internet connection, try again |

**Delete test file after success:**
```bash
rm test-db-connection.js
npm uninstall pg
```

**If Stuck:** Screenshot the error and ask Claude Chat: "I'm getting this database connection error. What does it mean?"

---

### STEP 5: Update GitHub Secret DATABASE_URL (5 minutes)

**Now update the GitHub secret with your REAL Railway URL:**

1. Go to GitHub.com → Your repo → Settings → Secrets → Actions
2. Find **`DATABASE_URL`** in the list
3. Click on it
4. Click **"Update"** button
5. **Replace** the temporary value with your **Railway DATABASE_URL**
6. Click **"Update secret"**

**Verify:**
- Secret name: `DATABASE_URL` ✓
- Value: Hidden (shows `•••••••`) ✓
- Updated: "Updated X seconds ago" ✓

**Important:** The secret value should be your full Railway URL starting with `postgresql://`

---

### STEP 6: Save Railway Info for Reference (5 minutes)

**Create a private reference document (DON'T commit this to git!):**

```bash
cat > RAILWAY-INFO.md << 'EOF'
# Railway Connection Info

## PostgreSQL Database

**Project Name:** trading-alerts-saas-v7
**Region:** [YOUR REGION - e.g., US West (Oregon)]
**Status:** Active
**Deployed:** [TODAY'S DATE]

## Connection Details

**DATABASE_URL:**
```
[YOUR FULL RAILWAY DATABASE_URL - KEEP PRIVATE!]
```

**Dashboard URL:**
https://railway.app/project/[YOUR-PROJECT-ID]

## Railway Plan

- **Plan:** Free Tier
- **Credits:** $5 included
- **Storage:** 5GB PostgreSQL
- **Note:** No credit card required for development

## Important Notes

1. This database is LIVE in production-like environment
2. Test all Prisma migrations here immediately after local testing
3. DO NOT commit this file to git (already in .gitignore)
4. Check Railway dashboard regularly for usage/credits
5. Upgrade to paid plan before production launch

## Quick Links

- Railway Dashboard: https://railway.app
- Railway Docs: https://docs.railway.app
- PostgreSQL Status: Check dashboard for uptime

EOF
```

**Edit and fill in your information:**
```bash
nano RAILWAY-INFO.md
```

**Add to .gitignore (ensure it's not committed):**
```bash
echo "RAILWAY-INFO.md" >> .gitignore
echo "RAILWAY-CREDENTIALS.txt" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "chore: ignore Railway credentials"
```

---

### ✅ Checkpoint: Milestone 2.3 Complete

You should now have:
- ✅ Railway account created
- ✅ PostgreSQL database deployed and active
- ✅ Database connection tested successfully from local machine
- ✅ GitHub secret DATABASE_URL updated with Railway URL
- ✅ Railway info saved for reference (not committed)

**CRITICAL WIN:** Your database is live in Week 2! When you build your app in Phase 3, you'll test on this production-like database immediately. No surprises later!

**Time Spent:** ~1.5 hours
**Next:** Milestone 2.4 - Prisma Workflow Understanding

---

## 📚 MILESTONE 2.4: Prisma Workflow Understanding (30 minutes)

### Overview
Learn how Prisma database migrations work. You won't execute this until Phase 3, but understanding it now prevents confusion later.

**What is Prisma?** A tool that talks to PostgreSQL for you. You write a schema (like a blueprint), Prisma creates tables automatically.

---

### STEP 1: Understanding Prisma Basics (15 minutes)

**Read this carefully - ask Claude Chat if anything is unclear!**

#### What is Prisma?

Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that:
- Converts TypeScript code into SQL queries
- Manages database schema and migrations
- Provides type-safe database access

**Think of it like this:**

```
Without Prisma (old way):
You write SQL → "CREATE TABLE users (id SERIAL, name VARCHAR(255));"
You query manually → "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;"
Risk: Typos, SQL injection, no type safety

With Prisma (modern way):
You write schema → model User { id Int @id @default(autoincrement()), name String }
Prisma creates table automatically
You query → const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: 1 } })
Benefits: Type-safe, auto-completion, no SQL injection
```

#### What is `prisma/schema.prisma`?

This is the "blueprint" file where you define your database structure:

```prisma
// Example from your Part 2 build-order
model User {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  email         String    @unique
  name          String?
  password      String?
  tier          UserTier  @default(FREE)
  emailVerified DateTime?
  alerts        Alert[]
}

enum UserTier {
  FREE
  PRO
}
```

**This says:**
- Create a "users" table
- "id" column is primary key, auto-generated
- "email" column must be unique
- "tier" defaults to FREE
- User can have multiple alerts

#### What are Migrations?

Migrations are **change snapshots** that update your database:

```
Migration 1: "Create users table"
Migration 2: "Add tier column to users"
Migration 3: "Create alerts table"
```

Each migration is a folder with SQL inside. Prisma generates these automatically!

---

### STEP 2: The Prisma Workflow (15 minutes)

**You'll do this in Phase 3 Part 2. For now, just understand the process:**

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**KEY INSIGHT:** Test on Railway IMMEDIATELY after local test. Don't wait until Phase 10!

**The Commands You'll Use in Phase 3:**

| Command | When | What It Does |
|---------|------|--------------|
| `npx prisma migrate dev --name init` | After writing schema | Creates migration + updates local DB |
| `npx prisma studio` | To view local database | Opens GUI to see tables |
| `DATABASE_URL=[Railway] npx prisma migrate deploy` | After local migration works | Applies migration to Railway |
| `DATABASE_URL=[Railway] npx prisma studio` | To verify Railway | Opens GUI to see Railway tables |
| `npx prisma generate` | After schema changes | Regenerates TypeScript types |

**Common Questions:**

**Q: Do I need local PostgreSQL?**
A: No! You can develop against Railway directly. But local is faster for testing.

**Q: What if I make a mistake in the schema?**
A: Create a new migration to fix it. Migrations are sequential.

**Q: Can I delete and start over?**
A: Yes! Use `npx prisma migrate reset` (local only). Don't reset Railway!

**Q: What if Railway and local get out of sync?**
A: Run `DATABASE_URL=[Railway] npx prisma migrate deploy` to sync Railway to your latest migrations.

### ✅ Checkpoint: Milestone 2.4 Complete

You should now understand:
- ✅ What Prisma is and why we use it
- ✅ What `prisma/schema.prisma` defines
- ✅ What migrations are (change snapshots)
- ✅ The workflow: schema → local migration → Railway deployment
- ✅ The commands you'll use in Phase 3
- ✅ Why testing on Railway early prevents problems

**Note:** You don't execute this until Phase 3 Part 2. This milestone is just for understanding!

**Time Spent:** ~30 minutes
**Next:** Milestone 2.5 - Docker Configuration

---

## 🐳 MILESTONE 2.5: Docker Configuration (1 hour)

### Overview
Create Docker configuration for the Flask MT5 service. **Docker is OPTIONAL for local development** - you can run Flask with `python run.py`. Docker is required for Railway deployment later.

**Beginner-Friendly Note:** If Docker feels overwhelming, you can develop Flask locally without it and add Docker later before deployment.

---

### STEP 1: Start Aider (2 minutes)

```bash
py -3.11 -m aider --model anthropic/MiniMax-M2
```

---

### STEP 2: Create Dockerfile for Flask (25 minutes)

**Copy and paste this EXACT prompt to Aider:**

```
Create Dockerfile for Flask MT5 service

Location: mt5-service/Dockerfile

Requirements:
- Use Python 3.11-slim as base image
- Install system dependencies for MetaTrader5 library
- Set working directory to /app
- Copy requirements.txt and install Python dependencies
- Copy application code (app/, indicators/, run.py)
- Expose port 5001
- Use gunicorn as production WSGI server
- Set environment variables for production mode
- Follow Docker best practices (multi-stage build, non-root user, layer caching)
- Include health check endpoint

Show me the complete Dockerfile for approval.
```

**What Aider Will Generate:**

A Dockerfile with sections like:
```dockerfile
# Base image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gcc \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements and install
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 5001

# Run with gunicorn
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5001", "run:app"]
```

**Review the Output:**
- Check base image: `python:3.11-slim` ✓
- Check port: `5001` ✓
- Check entry point: `gunicorn` ✓
- Check working directory: `/app` ✓

**Approve:**
Type in Aider: `Yes, create this file`

**Verify:**
```bash
cat mt5-service/Dockerfile
```

---

### STEP 3: Create docker-compose.yml (25 minutes)

**Copy and paste this EXACT prompt to Aider:**

```
Create docker-compose.yml for local development environment

Location: docker-compose.yml (project root)

Requirements:
- Define 2 services: postgres (database) and mt5-service (Flask app)
- PostgreSQL service:
  - Use postgres:15 image
  - Port 5432
  - Environment: POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_DB
  - Volume for data persistence
- MT5 service:
  - Build from ./mt5-service
  - Port 5001:5001
  - Environment variables from .env file
  - Depends on postgres service
  - Volume mount for hot-reload development
- Network: Custom bridge network for service communication
- Follow docker-compose best practices

Show me the complete docker-compose.yml for approval.
```

**What Aider Will Generate:**

A docker-compose.yml with:
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: trading_alerts_dev
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  mt5-service:
    build: ./mt5-service
    ports:
      - "5001:5001"
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/trading_alerts_dev
      FLASK_ENV: development
    volumes:
      - ./mt5-service:/app

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

**Review the Output:**
- Check services: `postgres` and `mt5-service` ✓
- Check ports: 5432, 5001 ✓
- Check dependencies: mt5-service depends on postgres ✓
- Check volume mounts for development ✓

**Approve:**
Type in Aider: `Yes, create this file`

**Verify:**
```bash
cat docker-compose.yml
```

**Exit Aider:**
```
/exit
```

---

### STEP 4: Test Docker Build (10 minutes) - OPTIONAL

**Note:** This will fail because Flask code doesn't exist yet. That's completely normal!

**Try building (optional - just to see the process):**

```bash
cd mt5-service
docker build -t mt5-service .
```

**Expected Error:**
```
ERROR: failed to solve: failed to read dockerfile: open /path/to/mt5-service/requirements.txt: no such file or directory
```

**This is NORMAL!** The Flask code doesn't exist until Phase 3 Part 6.

**Beginner Note:**
- You DON'T need Docker working now
- Docker is for **later deployment**, not local development
- You'll test Docker properly in Phase 3 when Flask code exists

---

### STEP 5: Commit Docker Configuration (5 minutes)

```bash
git add mt5-service/Dockerfile docker-compose.yml
git commit -m "feat: add Docker configuration for Flask service and local development"
git push
```

---

### ✅ Checkpoint: Milestone 2.5 Complete

You should now have:
- ✅ `mt5-service/Dockerfile` created
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` created
- ✅ Docker configuration ready for Phase 4 deployment
- ✅ Understanding: Docker is optional for local dev

**Important:** You don't need Docker running yet. These files are ready for when you deploy to Railway in Phase 4.

**Time Spent:** ~1 hour
**Next:** Milestone 2.6 - Testing Framework Setup

---

## 🧪 MILESTONE 2.6: Testing Framework Setup (30 minutes)

# Reinstall aider
pip install -U aider-chat

# Or use full path
py -3.11 -m aider --model anthropic/MiniMax-M2
```

**Ask Claude Chat:** Screenshot the error for specific help

---

#### Issue: GitHub Actions workflows not visible

**Symptoms:**
- Actions tab is empty
- Workflows don't appear

**Solution:**
1. Ensure files are in `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Ensure files end with `.yml` extension
3. Ensure you pushed to the repository: `git push`
4. Refresh GitHub page (hard refresh: Ctrl+F5)

**Ask Claude Chat:** Screenshot the GitHub Actions page

---

#### Issue: Railway database connection fails

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: ECONNREFUSED
Error: ENOTFOUND
```

**Solution:**
1. Check Railway dashboard - is database "Active"?
2. Verify DATABASE_URL is correct (copy again from Railway)
3. Check your internet connection
4. Try connecting from Railway console (Settings → Terminal)

**Ask Claude Chat:** Screenshot the error for diagnosis

---

#### Issue: GitHub secret not working in workflow

**Symptoms:**
- Workflow fails with "secret not found"
- Workflow shows empty value for secret

**Solution:**
1. Check secret NAME matches exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Ensure secret has a VALUE (not empty)
3. Re-save the secret (Edit → Update)
4. Re-run the workflow after saving

**Ask Claude Chat:** Screenshot the workflow error

---

#### Issue: Jest test fails

**Symptoms:**
```
Test suite failed to run
Cannot find module...
```

**Solution:**
