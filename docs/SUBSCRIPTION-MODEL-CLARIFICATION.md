## 🎯 Subscription Model Overview

### Confirmed Model: **Option A - Auto-Renewal with Optional Codes**

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ Subscriptions **AUTO-RENEW** monthly (standard SaaS behavior)
- ✅ Users **STAY SUBSCRIBED** even without codes
- ✅ Affiliate codes are **OPTIONAL** for users
- ✅ Users can enter code for **NEXT billing cycle** via input box
- ✅ Reminder system prompts users to enter codes
- ✅ **MONTHLY ONLY** - No annual subscriptions during early stage

**Business Rationale:**
- Standard SaaS practice (like Netflix, Spotify, etc.)
- Lower churn - users don't lose access
- Users incentivized to find codes to save money
- Affiliates compete for users' attention monthly
- Flexible for ongoing development and feature changes

---

## 📅 Monthly-Only Subscription

### Decision: Skip Annual Subscriptions for Early Stage

**Why Monthly-Only:**

1. **Avoid High Commitment**
   - Annual subscriptions lock users for 12 months
   - Harder to make significant changes or pivots
   - Users hesitant to commit long-term to new SaaS

2. **Development Flexibility**
   - Still developing features and functionalities
   - May need to adjust pricing or features
   - Easier to iterate with monthly subscriptions

3. **Early Stage Strategy**
   - Build trust with monthly subscriptions first
   - Add annual option later (with discount) when product mature
   - Lower barrier to entry for new users

**Pricing Structure:**
```
PRO Plan (Monthly Only):
- Trial Period: 7-day free trial (no credit card required)
- Regular Price: $29.00/month (after trial ends)
- With Affiliate Code: $23.20/month (20% discount)
- Auto-renews monthly
- Cancel anytime

Trial Details:
- 7-day free trial with full PRO access
- No credit card required during trial
- After 7 days: Auto-converts to $29/month (if payment method added)
- Or downgrade to FREE tier (if no payment method)
- One trial per user (lifetime)

❌ NO Annual Plan Yet:
- Will be introduced in later phase
- After product is stable and mature
- Likely at ~$290/year (save ~17%)
```

**When to Add Annual:**
- After 6-12 months of operation
- When feature set is stable
- When user retention is proven
- When you want to offer bulk discount (e.g., 2 months free)

---

## 🎁 7-Day Free Trial (PRO Tier)

### Trial Activation and Flow

**Day 0 (Trial Starts):**
```
User clicks "Start 7-Day Trial" on pricing page
User account created (no credit card required)
User tier: FREE (actual tier)
Trial status: ACTIVE
Effective tier: PRO (trial gives PRO access)
User gets full PRO features immediately:
  ✅ 15 symbols
  ✅ 9 timeframes
  ✅ 20 alerts
  ✅ 50 watchlist items
```

**Day 5 (Reminder):**
```
Email sent: "2 days left in your trial. Add payment to continue PRO access."
Dashboard banner: "⏰ Your trial ends in 2 days. Add payment to keep PRO features."
User can:
  - Add payment method → Trial converts to paid after 7 days
  - Do nothing → Trial expires, downgrade to FREE tier
  - Cancel trial → Immediate downgrade to FREE tier
```

**Day 7 (Trial Ends):**

**Scenario A: User Added Payment During Trial**
```
Trial status: CONVERTED
User tier: PRO
Subscription status: ACTIVE (auto-renews)
First charge: $29.00/month (or $23.20 if affiliate code used)
User keeps all PRO features
```

**Scenario B: User Did NOT Add Payment**
```
Trial status: EXPIRED
User tier: FREE (downgraded)
Subscription status: INACTIVE
No charge
User loses PRO features:
  ❌ Only 5 symbols now
  ❌ Only 3 timeframes now
  ❌ Only 5 alerts now
Can upgrade to PRO anytime (no second trial)
```

**Trial Business Rules:**
- ✅ One free trial per user (lifetime)
- ✅ Tracked via `hasUsedFreeTrial` field
- ✅ Cannot restart trial after cancellation
- ✅ Cannot get trial if already on PRO tier
- ✅ Trial is provider-agnostic (works with Stripe, dLocal, etc.)

---

## 🔄 Auto-Renewal with Optional Codes

### How It Works

**Month 1 (Initial Signup - After Trial or Direct):**
```
OPTION A: User finished 7-day trial, added payment
Trial converted to paid subscription
Subscription status: ACTIVE (auto-renews)
First charge: $29.00 (or $23.20 if affiliate code used during trial)

OPTION B: User skipped trial, went straight to paid
User enters affiliate code: "SMITH-ABC123"
User pays: $23.20 (20% discount)
Subscription status: ACTIVE (auto-renews)
Affiliate earns: $4.64 commission
```

**Month 2 (First Renewal - No Code Entered):**
```
7 days before renewal: Email reminder sent
"Your PRO subscription renews on Dec 5 for $29.00"
"Want to save 20%? Enter an affiliate code in your billing settings!"

User doesn't enter code
Renewal date arrives
Stripe auto-charges: $29.00 (full price)
Subscription continues
No affiliate earns commission
```

**Month 3 (Renewal - User Enters Code):**
```
10 days before renewal: User sees in-app notification
"💡 Renewal coming! Enter code to save 20%"

User clicks notification → Goes to billing page
User enters new code: "JONES-XYZ789" in input box
User clicks "Apply to Next Billing"
System saves code for next renewal

Renewal date arrives
Stripe auto-charges: $23.20 (20% discount)
Affiliate JONES earns: $4.64 commission
Subscription continues
```

**Month 4 (Renewal - Code Expires):**
```
Code "JONES-XYZ789" was one-time use (already USED)
Code expired at end of previous month
No valid code for this renewal

Renewal date arrives
Stripe auto-charges: $29.00 (full price)
Subscription continues
No affiliate earns commission

User receives email: "You paid $29.00. Want to save next month? Find a new code!"
```

### Key Points:

✅ **User never loses access** (even without codes)
✅ **User can skip finding codes** (pays full price)
✅ **User incentivized to find codes** (saves money)
✅ **Affiliates compete monthly** (post new codes on social media)
✅ **Codes are one-time use** (user needs new code each month)
✅ **Codes expire monthly** (old codes don't work)

### Code Validation Flow

**When user enters code:**

```typescript
// app/api/user/billing/apply-code/route.ts
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const session = await getServerSession();
  const { code } = await req.json();

  // 1. Validate code exists and is valid
  const affiliateCode = await prisma.affiliateCode.findUnique({
    where: { code }
  });

  if (!affiliateCode) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Invalid code' },
      { status: 400 }
    );
  }

  // 2. Check code is ACTIVE (not USED, EXPIRED, CANCELLED)
  if (affiliateCode.status !== 'ACTIVE') {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'This code has already been used or expired' },
      { status: 400 }
    );
  }

  // 3. Check code hasn't expired
  if (affiliateCode.expiresAt < new Date()) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'This code has expired' },
      { status: 400 }
    );
  }

  // 4. Check code hasn't been used
  if (affiliateCode.usedBy !== null) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'This code has already been used' },
      { status: 400 }
    );
  }

  // 5. Save code to user's subscription metadata (for next billing)
  const subscription = await prisma.subscription.findUnique({
    where: { userId: session.user.id }
  });

  // Update Stripe subscription metadata
  await stripe.subscriptions.update(subscription.stripeSubscriptionId, {
    metadata: {
      nextBillingCode: code,  // Code to apply on next renewal
      nextBillingCodeId: affiliateCode.id
    }
  });

  // 6. Save to database
  await prisma.subscription.update({
    where: { id: subscription.id },
    data: {
      nextBillingCodeId: affiliateCode.id  // Store for next billing
    }
  });

  return NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    message: 'Code will be applied on your next billing date',
    nextBillingAmount: 23.20,
    savings: 5.80
  });
}
```

**On renewal date (Stripe webhook):**

```typescript
// app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts
if (event.type === 'invoice.payment_succeeded') {
  const invoice = event.data.object;
  const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.retrieve(invoice.subscription);

  // Check if user has code scheduled for this billing cycle
  const nextBillingCode = subscription.metadata.nextBillingCode;

  if (nextBillingCode) {
    const code = await prisma.affiliateCode.findUnique({
      where: { code: nextBillingCode }
    });

    // Apply discount and create commission
    const regularPrice = 29.00;
    const discountedPrice = regularPrice * (1 - code.discountPercent / 100);
    const commissionAmount = discountedPrice * (code.commissionPercent / 100);

    await prisma.commission.create({
      data: {
        affiliateId: code.affiliateId,
        codeId: code.id,
        userId: invoice.customer,
        subscriptionId: invoice.subscription,
        regularPrice,
        discountPercent: code.discountPercent,
        discountedPrice,
        commissionPercent: code.commissionPercent,
        commissionAmount,
        status: 'PENDING'
      }
    });

    // Mark code as USED
    await prisma.affiliateCode.update({
      where: { id: code.id },
      data: {
        status: 'USED',
        usedBy: invoice.customer,
        usedAt: new Date()
      }
    });

    // Clear the code from subscription metadata (one-time use)
    await stripe.subscriptions.update(invoice.subscription, {
      metadata: {
        nextBillingCode: null,
        nextBillingCodeId: null
      }
    });

    await prisma.subscription.update({
      where: { stripeSubscriptionId: invoice.subscription },
      data: {
        nextBillingCodeId: null
      }
    });
  }
}
```

- Day -4: User finds code "BROWN-DEF456" on Instagram
- Day -4: User enters code in dashboard
- Day 0: Renewal occurs, charged $23.20
- Pattern continues...

**Result:** User saves 20% every month by actively finding codes

### Journey 2: Busy User Who Sometimes Forgets

**Month 1:**
- User signs up with code "SMITH-ABC123"
- Pays $23.20
- Subscription: ACTIVE

**Month 2:**
- Day -10, -7, -3: Receives reminders
- User busy, ignores emails
- Day 0: Renewal occurs, charged $29.00 (full price)
- Day +1: Receives email "You paid $29.00. Save next month?"
- User thinks: "Oops, forgot to enter code"

**Month 3:**
- Day -10: Receives reminder
- User remembers: "I don't want to pay full price again!"
- Day -8: User finds code "JONES-XYZ789"
- Day -8: User enters code
- Day 0: Renewal occurs, charged $23.20
- User receives: "You saved $5.80!"

**Month 4:**
- User busy again, forgets
- Day 0: Charged $29.00
- Pattern alternates...

**Result:** User pays full price some months, discounted price other months. Never loses access.

### Journey 3: User Who Doesn't Care About Codes

**Month 1:**
- User signs up WITHOUT code (direct)
- Pays $29.00 (full price)
- Subscription: ACTIVE

**Month 2-12:**
- Receives reminder emails
- User ignores them (doesn't care about saving)
- Day 0 each month: Charged $29.00
- Subscription continues

**Result:** User pays full price monthly, never uses codes. This is fine!

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Updates

**Subscription Table:**
```prisma
model Subscription {
  id                    String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId                String   @unique
  tier                  Tier     @default(FREE)
  stripeCustomerId      String?  @unique
  stripeSubscriptionId  String?  @unique
  stripePriceId         String?

  // Current billing cycle info
  currentPeriodStart    DateTime?
  currentPeriodEnd      DateTime?

  // Affiliate code tracking
  currentCodeId         String?  // Code used for CURRENT billing cycle
  nextBillingCodeId     String?  // Code scheduled for NEXT billing cycle

  // Pricing
  status                SubscriptionStatus
  cancelAtPeriodEnd     Boolean  @default(false)

  createdAt             DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt             DateTime @updatedAt

  // Relations
  user                  User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  currentCode           AffiliateCode? @relation("CurrentCode", fields: [currentCodeId], references: [id])
  nextBillingCode       AffiliateCode? @relation("NextBillingCode", fields: [nextBillingCodeId], references: [id])
}
```

### API Endpoints

**POST /api/user/billing/apply-code**
- Validates affiliate code
- Saves code for next billing cycle
- Returns success with new billing amount

**DELETE /api/user/billing/remove-code**
- Removes code from next billing cycle
- User will pay full price on next renewal

**GET /api/user/billing/next-renewal**
- Returns next renewal date
- Returns amount (with or without code)
- Returns code info if applied

### Cron Jobs for Reminders

**Daily Cron: Check Upcoming Renewals**
```typescript
// app/api/cron/renewal-reminders/route.ts
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const now = new Date();

  // Find subscriptions renewing in 10 days (first reminder)
  const day10 = new Date(now.getTime() + 10 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  const subscriptions10 = await prisma.subscription.findMany({
    where: {
      currentPeriodEnd: {
        gte: day10,
        lt: new Date(day10.getTime() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
      },
      nextBillingCodeId: null  // No code applied yet
    },
    include: { user: true }
  });

  for (const sub of subscriptions10) {
    await sendRenewalReminder(sub.user, 10);
  }

  // Repeat for 7 days, 3 days
  // ...

  return NextResponse.json({ sent: subscriptions10.length });
}
```

### Stripe Integration

**Update subscription metadata when code applied:**
```typescript
await stripe.subscriptions.update(subscriptionId, {
  metadata: {
    nextBillingCode: codeValue,
    nextBillingCodeId: codeId,
    affiliateName: affiliate.fullName
  }
});
```

**Apply code on renewal (webhook):**
```typescript
// On invoice.payment_succeeded
const metadata = subscription.metadata;
if (metadata.nextBillingCode) {
  // Apply discount, create commission
  // Mark code as USED
  // Clear metadata
}
```
