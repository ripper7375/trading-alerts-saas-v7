# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation that is no longer actively used but preserved for reference.

## Archive Structure

- **planning/** - Planning documents for completed features
- **checklists/** - Completed implementation checklists
- **summaries/** - Historical summary documents (superseded by current docs)
- **testing/** - Completed testing documentation
- **setup-guides/** - Standalone setup guides (merged into main docs)

## Why Files Are Archived

Files are moved here when they are:
1. Planning documents for completed work
2. Checklists with all items completed
3. Redundant summaries (when multiple docs cover same feature)
4. One-time testing/review documents (already executed)
5. Setup guides that have been consolidated into main documentation

## Accessing Archived Files

These files are still in git history and can be referenced if needed. They are moved to archive to keep the main `docs/` directory clean and focused on current, actively-used documentation.

## When to Archive

See `docs/FILE-ARCHIVE-ANALYSIS.md` for the analysis that determined which files to archive.
