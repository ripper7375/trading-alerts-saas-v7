## File Build Order

Build these files **in sequence** (dependencies flow top to bottom):

---

### File 1/[N]: `[path/to/file.ts]`

**Purpose:** [What this file does in 1-2 sentences]

**From v5-structure-division.md:**
> [Exact quote or description from v5-structure-division.md]

**Implementation Details:**
- **Reference Guide:** `docs/implementation-guides/v5_part_[letter].md` Section [X.X]
- **Pattern:** `docs/policies/05-coding-patterns.md` → **Pattern [N]: [Pattern Name]**
- **OpenAPI Reference:** `docs/[spec].yaml` → Schema: `[SchemaName]`
- **Seed Code Reference:** `seed-code/[path]/[file]` (lines [X-Y])

**Dependencies:**
- Requires: [File from earlier part or earlier in this part]
- Creates: [What this file provides for later files]

**Build Steps:**

1. **Read Requirements**
   ```
   - v5-structure-division.md Part [N] description
   - v5_part_[letter].md Section [X.X]
   - 05-coding-patterns.md Pattern [N]
   - [OpenAPI spec] [Schema name]
   - seed-code/[reference file]
   ```

2. **Plan Implementation**
   ```
   - Use Pattern [N] as base
   - Customize for [specific requirements]
   - Ensure [specific features]:
     • [Feature 1]
     • [Feature 2]
     • [Feature 3]
   ```

3. **Generate Code**
   ```
   - Start with Pattern [N] template
   - Add [specific customizations]
   - Include:
     • TypeScript types (no `any`)
     • Error handling (try/catch)
     • [Specific requirement 1]
     • [Specific requirement 2]
   ```

4. **Validate**
   ```
   Check against:
   - 00-tier-specifications.md: [Specific check]
   - 01-approval-policies.md: [Specific criteria]
   - 02-quality-standards.md: [Quality requirements]
   - 03-architecture-rules.md: [Architecture constraints]
   - OpenAPI compliance: Response matches [SchemaName]
   ```

5. **Approval Criteria**
   ```
   ✅ 0 Critical issues
   ✅ ≤2 High issues (auto-fixable)
   ✅ TypeScript types present
   ✅ Error handling present
   ✅ [Specific requirement met]
   ✅ OpenAPI schema compliance
   ```

6. **Commit**
   ```
   If approved:
     git add [file path]
     git commit -m "[type]([scope]): [description]

     - Validation: 0 Critical, X High, Y Medium, Z Low
     - Pattern used: Pattern [N]
     - Model: MiniMax M2"
   ```

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] TypeScript: No `any` types
- [ ] Error Handling: Try/catch present
- [ ] JSDoc: Function documented
- [ ] [Specific check 1]
- [ ] [Specific check 2]
- [ ] OpenAPI: Response matches schema
- [ ] Dependencies: All imports resolve

**Expected Output:**
```typescript
// Brief code snippet showing structure
[Example code structure]
```

**Known Issues / Edge Cases:**
- ⚠️ [Edge case 1]: [How to handle]
- ⚠️ [Edge case 2]: [How to handle]
