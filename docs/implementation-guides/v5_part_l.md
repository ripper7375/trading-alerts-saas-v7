## Overview

This guide provides the business logic and requirements for implementing the e-commerce and billing system using Stripe for the 2-tier subscription model (FREE vs PRO).

### Purpose

Enable users to upgrade from FREE to PRO tier, manage subscriptions, view invoices, and handle payment-related operations through Stripe integration.

### Key Features

- 2-tier pricing (FREE: $0/month, PRO: $29/month)
- Stripe Checkout integration
- Subscription management (upgrade/downgrade)
- Invoice history and downloads
- Webhook handling for subscription events
- Email notifications for billing events

---

## Business Requirements

###1. 2-Tier Pricing Model

**FREE Tier:**
- Price: $0/month (no payment required)
- Features:
  - 5 symbols (XAUUSD only in V5)
  - 3 timeframes (M15, H1, D1)
  - 5 alerts
  - Basic support

**PRO Tier:**
- Price: $29/month
- Billing: Monthly recurring via Stripe
- Features:
  - 10 symbols (XAUUSD, EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD, BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XAGUSD, NDX100, US30)
  - 7 timeframes (M15, M30, H1, H2, H4, H8, D1)
  - 20 alerts
  - Priority support
  - Advanced features

### 2. Subscription Lifecycle

**User Journey - Upgrade to PRO:**
1. User on FREE tier clicks "Upgrade to PRO" button
2. System creates Stripe Checkout session
3. User redirected to Stripe-hosted checkout page
4. User completes payment with credit card
5. Stripe sends `checkout.session.completed` webhook
6. System updates user tier to PRO in database
7. System sends upgrade confirmation email
8. User redirected back to dashboard with PRO access

**User Journey - Cancel PRO (Downgrade to FREE):**
1. User on PRO tier clicks "Cancel Subscription" button
2. System shows confirmation modal: "Are you sure? You'll lose PRO features."
3. User confirms cancellation
4. System cancels Stripe subscription (immediate cancellation)
5. Stripe sends `customer.subscription.deleted` webhook
6. System updates user tier to FREE in database
7. System sends cancellation confirmation email
8. User continues with FREE tier access

**Subscription Status Sync:**
- System syncs with Stripe via webhooks (real-time)
- Backup: Daily cron job checks subscription status for all PRO users
- If Stripe subscription inactive → downgrade to FREE

### 3. Stripe Integration

**Checkout Flow:**

```typescript
// Create Checkout Session
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  customer_email: user.email,
  line_items: [{
    price: process.env.STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID, // $29/month
    quantity: 1,
  }],
  mode: 'subscription',
  success_url: `${process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL}/dashboard?upgrade=success`,
  cancel_url: `${process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL}/pricing?upgrade=cancelled`,
  metadata: {
    userId: user.id,
    tier: 'PRO',
  },
})
```

**Required Stripe Products:**

1. **PRO Monthly Subscription**
   - Product name: "Trading Alerts PRO"
   - Price: $29.00 USD
   - Billing: Monthly recurring
   - Price ID: Store in `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID` environment variable

### 4. Webhook Events Handling

**Critical Events:**

**`checkout.session.completed`:**
- User completed payment
- Action:
  1. Extract userId from metadata
  2. Update user tier to PRO
  3. Create Subscription record in database
  4. Send upgrade confirmation email
  5. Log event

**`customer.subscription.updated`:**
- Subscription details changed (e.g., payment method updated)
- Action:
  1. Log event
  2. Sync subscription data to database
  3. If status changed from active → inactive: downgrade to FREE

**`customer.subscription.deleted`:**
- Subscription cancelled or expired
- Action:
  1. Update user tier to FREE
  2. Delete/mark Subscription record as cancelled
  3. Send cancellation email
  4. Log event

**`invoice.payment_failed`:**
- Payment failed (expired card, insufficient funds)
- Action:
  1. Send payment failure email to user
  2. Keep PRO access for 3 days grace period
  3. If not resolved after 3 days → downgrade to FREE
  4. Log event

**`invoice.payment_succeeded`:**
- Monthly payment successful
- Action:
  1. Update subscription nextBillingDate
  2. Send payment receipt email
  3. Log event

**Webhook Security:**
- Verify webhook signature using Stripe webhook secret
- Return 400 Bad Request if signature invalid
- Return 200 OK immediately after processing
- Process events asynchronously to avoid timeout

### 5. Invoice Management

**Invoice History:**
- Fetch invoices from Stripe API
- Display in user's billing settings page
- Show: Date, Amount, Status (Paid/Failed), Download link

**Invoice Data:**
```typescript
interface Invoice {
  id: string
  date: Date
  amount: number          // $29.00
  status: 'paid' | 'open' | 'failed'
  invoicePdfUrl: string   // Stripe-hosted PDF
  description: string     // "Trading Alerts PRO - Monthly"
}
```

**Pagination:**

---

## Security Considerations

### Webhook Security

**Signature Verification:**
```typescript
const sig = req.headers['stripe-signature']
const webhookSecret = process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

try {
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
    req.body,
    sig,
    webhookSecret
  )
  // Process event
} catch (err) {
  return res.status(400).send(`Webhook Error: ${err.message}`)
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Always verify signature before processing
- Use environment variable for webhook secret
- Log all webhook events
- Handle idempotency (same event received multiple times)

### PCI Compliance

**Stripe Handles:**
- Credit card storage
- Payment processing
- PCI compliance

**We NEVER:**
- Store credit card numbers
- Handle raw card data
- Process payments directly

**We Store:**
- Stripe customer ID
- Stripe subscription ID
- Subscription status
- Last 4 digits of card (from Stripe)

---

## Migration from V4

**Changes:**
- Remove ENTERPRISE tier completely
- Update pricing: PRO is now $29/month (was $19/month in V4)
- Simplify subscription logic (only 2 tiers instead of 3)

**Database Migration:**
```sql
-- Update existing ENTERPRISE users to PRO
UPDATE users SET tier = 'PRO' WHERE tier = 'ENTERPRISE';

-- Cancel ENTERPRISE subscriptions (manual process)
-- Contact ENTERPRISE users about tier change
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Webhook Processing

**Async Processing:**
- Receive webhook → Return 200 OK immediately
- Queue event for background processing
- Process event asynchronously (avoids timeout)

**Retry Logic:**
- Stripe retries failed webhooks automatically
- Implement idempotency to handle duplicate events

### Invoice Fetching

**Caching:**
- Cache invoice list for 5 minutes
- Invalidate cache on new payment

**Pagination:**
- Fetch invoices in batches of 12
- Load more on demand

---
