## 🎉 Congratulations!

**If you're ready:** You've completed Phase 1 of the V7 workflow! You've created the "AI constitution" - the policies and documentation that will guide Aider through autonomous development of 170+ files.

**What you've accomplished:**
- ✅ Created 7 comprehensive policy documents
- ✅ Setup Aider with MiniMax M2
- ✅ Documented architecture and implementation guide
- ✅ Prepared OpenAPI type generation
- ✅ Setup Postman testing infrastructure
- ✅ Verified Aider understands the project

**Value created:** Your 14-hour investment in policies will save 100+ hours in Phase 3!

**Next stop:** Phase 2 - Foundation Setup (5 hours)
