## PHASE 1: DOCUMENTATION & POLICY CREATION
### Timeline: Week 1, Days 3-7 (14 hours)
### Goal: Create policies that guide Aider

💡 BEGINNER TIP: This is the MOST IMPORTANT phase! You're creating the "AI constitution" - the rules Aider follows. Quality here = quality later!

---

### MILESTONE 1.0: Setup Project Repository (1.5 hours)

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:** There are **TWO different folder structures** in V7:

1. **📦 V7 RESOURCES Structure** (what you create NOW in Phase 1)
   - Purpose: Store documentation, policies, seed code
   - Location: `trading-alerts-saas-v7/` (your GitHub repo root)
   - Contains: docs/, seed-code/, policies/, scripts/, postman/
   - **This is your "instruction manual" for AI**

2. **🏗️ CODE BUILDING Structure** (what you create LATER in Phase 3)
   - Purpose: The actual Next.js application code
   - Location: `trading-alerts-saas-v7/trading-alerts-saas/` (subfolder)
   - Contains: app/, components/, lib/, prisma/ (per v5-structure-division.md)
   - **This is your actual SaaS application**

**Think of it like this:**
- 📦 Resources = The blueprint, tools, and reference materials
- 🏗️ Code = The actual house you build using the blueprint

💡 **Don't worry!** Phase 3 will guide you to create the code structure. For now, focus on organizing resources!

---☐ STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository (15 minutes)
   What: Online home for your project
   Why: Store code, enable deployment
   How:
   1. Go to GitHub.com
   2. Click "+ New repository"
   3. Name: trading-alerts-saas-v7
   4. Description: "Trading Alerts SaaS with MiniMax M2 AI Development"
   5. Public or Private (your choice)
   6. ✅ Initialize with README
   7. Click "Create repository"
   
   Verify: Can see repo on GitHub ✓

☐ STEP 2: Clone Repository Locally (5 minutes)
   What: Download to your computer
   Why: Work on it locally
   How:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/trading-alerts-saas-v7.git
   cd trading-alerts-saas-v7
   ```
   
   Verify: Folder exists with README.md ✓

☐ STEP 3: Create Folder Structure (10 minutes)
   What: Organize documentation and seed code
   Why: Keep everything organized
   How:
   ```
   mkdir -p docs
   mkdir -p docs/diagrams
   mkdir -p docs/policies
   mkdir -p docs/architecture
   mkdir -p postman
   mkdir -p scripts/openapi
   mkdir -p seed-code
   ```
   
   Verify: Run `ls -la` and see all folders ✓

☐ STEP 4: REMOVED

☐ STEP 5: Copy Essential Documents (20 minutes)
   What: Add your existing docs
   Why: Aider needs these to build
   How: Copy these files to docs/:
   - v5_part_a.md through v5_part_j.md
   - v5-structure-division.md
   - trading_alerts_openapi.yaml
   - flask_mt5_openapi.yaml
   - phase_milestones_v7_minimax_m2.txt (this file!)
   - All 12 mermaid diagrams to docs/diagrams/
   
   Verify: Run `ls docs/` and see all files ✓

☐ STEP 6: Initial Commit (10 minutes)
   What: Save everything to GitHub
   Why: Backup + share with AI tools
   How:
   ```
   git add docs/ seed-code/
   git commit -m "Add project documentation and 3 seed code repositories"
   git push
   ```
   
   Verify: See files on GitHub ✓

✅ CHECKPOINT: Repository ready

💡 BEGINNER TIP: Committing often is good! It's like saving your game progress.

---

### MILESTONE 1.1: Create Policy Documents (8 hours)

THIS IS THE HEART OF V7! 💖

You'll create 6 policy documents with Claude Chat (me!). These become Aider's "instruction manual" - they tell Aider when to approve code, when to fix issues, and when to ask you.

💡 BEGINNER TIP: Take your time here! These policies will save you 100+ hours later!

---

### 📦 UNDERSTANDING YOUR SEED CODE (Important!)

Before creating policies, understand what seed code you have and when to use each:

**1. market_ai_engine.py (Flask/MT5 Service)**
   - **What:** Python Flask server that connects to MetaTrader 5
   - **When Aider uses it:** Building Part 6 (Flask MT5 Service)
   - **Reference for:** Flask routes, MT5 connection, indicator fetching
   - **Location:** seed-code/market_ai_engine.py

**2. nextjs/saas-starter (Backend/API Foundation)**
   - **What:** Next.js SaaS template with auth, database, payments
   - **When Aider uses it:** Parts 5 (Auth), 7 (API Routes), 12 (E-commerce), **Part 17 (Affiliate Marketing)**
   - **Reference for:**
     - NextAuth.js configuration
     - Prisma database patterns
     - Stripe payment integration
     - API route structure
     - Middleware patterns
     - **Stripe webhook handling (critical for commission calculation)**
   - **Location:** seed-code/saas-starter/

**3. next-shadcn-dashboard-starter (Frontend/UI Foundation)**
   - **What:** Next.js dashboard with shadcn/ui components
   - **When Aider uses it:** Parts 8-14 (All UI components), **Part 17 (Affiliate Portal & Admin Dashboard)**
   - **Reference for:**
     - Dashboard layouts
     - shadcn/ui component usage
     - Chart components
     - Form patterns
     - Navigation structure
     - Responsive design
     - **Analytics dashboards (for affiliate earnings tracking)**
     - **Admin management interfaces (for affiliate approval)**
   - **Location:** seed-code/next-shadcn-dashboard-starter/

💡 **How Aider Uses Seed Code:**
When you tell Aider "Build Part 8: Dashboard", it will:
1. Read the part requirements from v5_part_h.md
2. Check coding patterns from policy 05-coding-patterns.md
3. **Look at seed-code/next-shadcn-dashboard-starter/ for reference**
4. Adapt the patterns to your specific requirements
5. Build your custom dashboard

Seed code = inspiration and patterns, NOT copy/paste!

---

#### POLICY 1: Approval Policies (1 hour)

**What it does:** Tells Aider when to auto-approve, auto-fix, or escalate

**How to create it:**

1. Open Claude Chat (you're here now!)
2. Copy and paste this prompt:

```
I'm creating approval-policies.md for my Aider AI system using MiniMax M2.
I'm a complete beginner building a Trading Alerts SaaS with Affiliate Marketing.

My project context:
- Trading Alerts SaaS with 2 tiers: FREE (5 symbols), PRO (15 symbols)
- FREE: 5 symbols (BTCUSD, EURUSD, USDJPY, US30, XAUUSD) × 3 timeframes (H1, H4, D1)
- PRO: 15 symbols × 9 timeframes (M5, M15, M30, H1, H2, H4, H8, H12, D1)
- **2-sided marketplace:** Affiliate marketing program (Part 17, 67 files)
  * Affiliates earn 20% commission on referred PRO subscriptions
  * Separate JWT authentication for affiliates (not NextAuth)
  * Admin approval workflow for affiliates and commissions
- Next.js 15 frontend + Flask backend + MT5 integration
- PostgreSQL database on Railway
- Using MiniMax M2 API for cost-effective autonomous development
- 3 seed code repositories for reference:
  * market_ai_engine.py (Flask/MT5)
  * nextjs/saas-starter (Backend/Auth/Payments/Affiliate)
  * next-shadcn-dashboard-starter (Frontend/UI/Affiliate Portal/Admin)

Create a comprehensive approval-policies.md that defines:

1. AUTO-APPROVE CONDITIONS (when Aider commits without asking me):
   - Code quality requirements (TypeScript types, error handling, JSDoc)
   - Security requirements (no secrets, input validation, tier validation)
   - API contract compliance (matches OpenAPI specs exactly)
   - Architecture compliance (files in correct locations)
   - Validation results (0 Critical issues, ≤2 High issues from Claude Code)

2. AUTO-FIX CONDITIONS (when Aider fixes and retries):
   - Missing TypeScript types
   - Missing error handling
   - Missing JSDoc comments
   - ESLint/Prettier errors
   - Maximum 3 retry attempts

3. ESCALATE CONDITIONS (when Aider stops and asks me):
   - Critical security vulnerabilities
   - OpenAPI contract violations that can't be auto-fixed
   - Policy conflicts or unclear rules
   - Architectural design decisions
   - New npm/pip dependencies
   - Database schema changes (Prisma migrations)
   - Breaking changes to existing APIs
   - >3 High severity issues from Claude Code validation
   - Unclear requirements from specs

Include specific examples for each condition. Write it for someone with little 
coding experience - explain WHY each rule matters.

Format it clearly with sections and subsections.
```

3. Claude Chat (me) will generate a complete policy document
4. Review it (I'll explain anything unclear!)
5. Copy the content
6. Create file: `docs/policies/01-approval-policies.md`
7. Paste content
8. Save file

Commit:
```
git add docs/policies/01-approval-policies.md
git commit -m "Add approval policies for Aider with MiniMax M2"
git push
```

✅ DONE: Approval policies created

💡 BEGINNER TIP: If anything in the policy is confusing, ask me to explain!

---

#### POLICY 2: Quality Standards (1.5 hours)

**What it does:** Defines what "good code" looks like

**How to create it:**

Ask Claude Chat:

```
Create quality-standards.md for my Aider system using MiniMax M2.

    - How they connect

Explain each concept simply with diagrams where helpful!
```

Same process: generate → review → create file → commit

✅ DONE: Architecture rules created

---

#### POLICY 4: Escalation Triggers (1 hour)

**What it does:** When Aider should stop and ask you

Ask Claude Chat:

```
Create escalation-triggers.md for my Aider system using MiniMax M2. 
Define exactly when Aider should stop and notify me.

Define 10 escalation categories:

#### POLICY 6: Aider Instructions (1 hour)

**What it does:** How Aider should operate

Ask Claude Chat:

```
Create aider-instructions.md - this is Aider's "operating manual" for 
working with MiniMax M2 API that tells it HOW to work.

Include:

1. INITIALIZATION
   Files to load on startup:
   - All 6 policy documents
   - v5-structure-division.md
   - OpenAPI specs
   - seed-code/market_ai_engine.py
   - PROGRESS.md

2. SEED CODE USAGE
   When to reference each seed code repository:
   
   **market_ai_engine.py:**
   - Use for: Part 6 (Flask MT5 Service)
   - Reference: Flask route patterns, MT5 API usage, indicator fetching
   - Adapt, don't copy: Use as pattern reference, customize for our OpenAPI spec
   
   **seed-code/saas-starter/:**
   - Use for: Parts 5 (Auth), 7 (API Routes), 12 (E-commerce), **Part 17 (Affiliate Marketing)**
   - Reference: NextAuth config, Prisma patterns, Stripe integration, middleware, **Stripe webhook handling**
   - Key files to check:
     * app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
     * lib/stripe.ts
     * middleware.ts
     * prisma/schema.prisma
     * **app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts (critical for commission calculation)**

   **seed-code/next-shadcn-dashboard-starter/:**
   - Use for: Parts 8-14 (All UI/Frontend), **Part 17 (Affiliate Portal & Admin Dashboard)**
   - Reference: Dashboard layout, shadcn/ui components, charts, forms, **analytics dashboards, admin interfaces**
   - Key files to check:
     * app/dashboard/layout.tsx
     * components/ui/* (shadcn components)
     * components/charts/*
     * lib/utils.ts
     * **Dashboard analytics patterns (for affiliate earnings)**
     * **Admin management table patterns (for affiliate approval)**
   
   **Important:** Seed code is REFERENCE only. Always:
   - Adapt to our OpenAPI contracts
   - Follow our tier system (FREE: 5 symbols × 3 timeframes, PRO: 15 symbols × 9 timeframes)
   - Use our specific business logic
   - Match our quality standards

3. WORKFLOW FOR EACH FILE
   Step-by-step process:
   
   Step 1: READ REQUIREMENTS
   - Read v5-structure-division.md for file location
   - Read OpenAPI spec for API contract
   - Read v5_part_X.md for implementation details
   - Read 05-coding-patterns.md for code template
   - CHECK RELEVANT SEED CODE (see "Seed Code Usage" above)
   
   Step 2: PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
   - Choose appropriate pattern from seed code
   - Adapt for specific endpoint/component
   - Ensure matches OpenAPI contract
   - List all requirements
   
   Step 3: GENERATE CODE
   - Use seed code pattern as inspiration
   - Customize for our requirements
   - Include all required elements
   - Follow quality standards
   
   Step 4: VALIDATE
   - Run: claude code "validate [filename]"
   - Parse validation output
   - Categorize issues by severity
   
   Step 5: DECIDE
   - Check 01-approval-policies.md
   - If all conditions met → APPROVE
   - If fixable issues → AUTO-FIX (max 3 attempts)
   - If stuck/unclear → ESCALATE
   
   Step 6: ACT
   - APPROVE: Commit with detailed message
   - AUTO-FIX: Fix issues, re-validate, retry
   - ESCALATE: Format message, notify human, WAIT
   
   Step 7: UPDATE PROGRESS
   - Update PROGRESS.md
   - Report status every 3 files

3. COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT
   Use conventional commits:
   ```
   feat(scope): description
   
   - Validation: X Critical, Y High, Z Medium issues
   - All approval conditions met: yes/no
   - Pattern used: [pattern name]
   - Model: MiniMax M2
   ```

4. ERROR HANDLING
   How to categorize Claude Code errors:
   - Critical: Security, contract violations → ESCALATE
   - High: Missing error handling, wrong types → AUTO-FIX
   - Medium: Missing JSDoc, formatting → AUTO-FIX
   - Low: Style issues → AUTO-FIX
   
   Auto-fix strategies:
   - Add missing types
   - Add try/catch blocks
   - Add JSDoc comments
   - Run prettier
   
   Decision logic:
   - 0 Critical + ≤2 High → APPROVE
   - Fixable issues + <3 tries → AUTO-FIX
   - Otherwise → ESCALATE

5. INTERACTION WITH HUMAN
   When to notify:
   - Starting new part
   - Every 3 files completed
   - Escalations
   - Part completed
   
   Escalation message format:
   ```
   ⚠️ ESCALATION REQUIRED ⚠️
   
   Issue Type: [category]
   File: [filename]
   Feature: [what you're building]
   
   Problem:
   [Clear explanation]
   
   Policy Gap:
   [Which policy is unclear]
   
   Suggested Solutions:
   1. [Option 1]
   2. [Option 2]
   
   Awaiting human decision...
   ```

6. PROGRESS TRACKING
   Update PROGRESS.md after each file:
   - Part name
   - Files completed
   - Issues found/fixed
   - Escalations raised
   - Time spent

7. TESTING PROTOCOL
   After building files:
   - Suggest manual testing steps
   - List Postman requests to test
   - Remind to test in browser

8. SELF-IMPROVEMENT
   - Learn from escalation resolutions
   - Note policy updates
   - Apply learnings to future files

9. MINIMAX M2 OPTIMIZATION
   - Use MiniMax M2 efficiently
   - Batch related operations
   - Minimize API calls where possible
   - Cost-conscious coding patterns

10. EXAMPLE SESSION
    Show complete workflow for building one file from start to finish.

Write it like a detailed instruction manual for an AI assistant using MiniMax M2!
```

Same process ✓

✅ DONE: All 6 policies created!

### POLICY REVIEW (30 minutes)

**Final quality check with Claude Chat:**

Ask me:

```
Review all 6 policy documents for consistency:

1. Check for contradictions between policies
2. Ensure tier rules consistent (FREE: 5 symbols × 3 timeframes, PRO: 15 symbols × 9 timeframes)
3. Verify approval conditions align with quality standards
4. Confirm escalation triggers align with approval policies
5. Check coding patterns follow architecture rules
6. Verify MiniMax M2 references are consistent

Files to review:
- docs/policies/01-approval-policies.md
- docs/policies/02-quality-standards.md
- docs/policies/03-architecture-rules.md
- docs/policies/04-escalation-triggers.md
- docs/policies/05-coding-patterns.md
- docs/policies/06-aider-instructions.md

List any inconsistencies or gaps.
```

Fix any issues I identify, then final commit:

```
git add docs/policies/
git commit -m "Complete policy suite for MiniMax M2 - Aider ready!"
git push
```

✅ CHECKPOINT: All 6 policies created, reviewed, committed

💡 BEGINNER INSIGHT: You just created the "AI constitution"! These 6 documents 
will guide 170 files of code. Quality here = quality everywhere!

### MILESTONE 1.2: OpenAPI Code Generation (1 hour)

**What:** Auto-generate TypeScript types from API specs
**Why:** Type safety - catch errors before runtime!

☐ STEP 1: Install OpenAPI Generator (10 minutes)
   ```
   npm install -g @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli
   openapi-generator-cli version
   ```
   
   Verify: Shows version number ✓

☐ STEP 2: Create Next.js Type Generation Script (15 minutes)
   Create: `scripts/openapi/generate-nextjs-types.sh`
   
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "📄 Generating TypeScript types from Next.js OpenAPI spec..."
   
   openapi-generator-cli generate \
     -i docs/trading_alerts_openapi.yaml \
     -g typescript-axios \
     -o lib/api-client \
     --additional-properties=supportsES6=true,npmVersion=8.0.0
   
   echo "✅ Next.js API types generated in lib/api-client/"
   echo "📝 Import types: import { UserProfile, Alert } from '@/lib/api-client'"
   ```
   
   Make executable:
   ```
   chmod +x scripts/openapi/generate-nextjs-types.sh
   ```

☐ STEP 3: Create Flask Type Generation Script (15 minutes)
   Create: `scripts/openapi/generate-flask-types.sh`
   
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "📄 Generating TypeScript types from Flask MT5 OpenAPI spec..."
   
   openapi-generator-cli generate \
     -i docs/flask_mt5_openapi.yaml \
     -g typescript-axios \
     -o lib/mt5-client \
     --additional-properties=supportsES6=true,npmVersion=8.0.0
   
   echo "✅ Flask MT5 types generated in lib/mt5-client/"
   echo "📝 Import types: import { IndicatorData } from '@/lib/mt5-client'"
   ```
   
   Make executable:
   ```
   chmod +x scripts/openapi/generate-flask-types.sh
   ```

☐ STEP 4: Test (Will Fail - That's OK!) (5 minutes)
   ```
   sh scripts/openapi/generate-nextjs-types.sh
   ```
   
   Expected: Error (Next.js project doesn't exist yet)
   
   💡 BEGINNER NOTE: This is normal! You'll run these in Phase 3.

☐ STEP 5: Commit (5 minutes)
   ```
   git add scripts/
   git commit -m "Add OpenAPI type generation scripts"
   git push
   ```

✅ CHECKPOINT: Type generation ready for Phase 3

💡 BEGINNER TIP: These scripts turn your OpenAPI specs into TypeScript types 
automatically. When you change the API spec, regenerate types - they stay in sync!
