## PHASE 2: CI/CD & DATABASE FOUNDATION
### Timeline: Week 2 (5 hours)
### Goal: Setup automation and deploy database EARLY

💡 BEGINNER TIP: We deploy the database in Week 2 (not Week 10!) to avoid 
"migration hell" - database problems at the end when everything depends on it.

---

### MILESTONE 2.1: GitHub Actions Setup (2 hours)

**What:** Automated testing on every code push
**Why:** Catch errors early, ensure quality

✅ **STATUS: ALREADY COMPLETED!**

The CI/CD workflows have been **professionally rebuilt** for autonomous development with Aider + MiniMax M2!

💡 **WHAT CHANGED:** The original workflows were replaced with a progressive, phase-aware system designed specifically for autonomous development. No manual setup needed!

---

#### ✅ Current CI/CD System (Progressive & Autonomous-Friendly)

**5 Active Workflows:**

1. **`openapi-validation.yml`** ✅ ACTIVE
   - Validates all OpenAPI specifications
   - Detects breaking changes
   - Posts PR comments with results
   - **Status:** Working perfectly

2. **`dependencies-security.yml`** ✅ ACTIVE
   - Weekly security scans (npm + Python)
   - Uses pip-audit (no authentication required)
   - Non-blocking during development
   - **Status:** Working perfectly

3. **`ci-flask.yml`** ✅ ACTIVE (Progressive)
   - Validates Flask application
   - Linting (flake8), type checking (mypy)
   - Security scans (pip-audit + bandit)
   - Unit tests (skips if tests/ empty - normal in Phase 1-2)
   - **Status:** Working perfectly with conditional checks

4. **`ci-nextjs-progressive.yml`** ✅ ACTIVE (Progressive)
   - Feature detection system
   - Progressive job activation:
     - ✅ check-project-status (always runs)
     - ⏭️ install-and-build (activates when next.config.js exists)
     - ⏭️ type-check (activates when tsconfig.json exists)
     - ⏭️ lint (runs, non-blocking)
     - ⏭️ test (activates when test files exist)
   - **Status:** Working perfectly - skips in Phase 1-2, activates in Phase 3

5. **`api-tests.yml`** ⏭️ STANDBY (Progressive)
   - Newman/Postman API integration tests
   - Checks for substantial Next.js project
   - **Status:** Skips gracefully until Phase 3

---

#### 📊 Design Principles

**Progressive Activation:**
- Workflows check for prerequisites before running
- Jobs activate incrementally as features are built
- No false negatives from missing Phase 3 features

**Non-Blocking:**
- Security scans are informative, not blocking (Phase 1-3)
- Linting issues warn but don't fail
- Only critical errors block (syntax, build failures)

**Informative Feedback:**
- Every skip explains WHY it skipped
- Every skip explains WHEN it will activate
- Summary jobs provide context and guidance

**Autonomous Development Ready:**
- Designed for Aider + Claude Code workflow
- CI provides guidance, not gatekeeping
- Aider can commit confidently without blocking

---

#### 🎯 Current Status (Phase 1-2)

**Expected Behavior:**
```
✅ OpenAPI Validation        ACTIVE & PASSING
✅ Dependencies Security      ACTIVE & PASSING
✅ Flask CI                   ACTIVE & PASSING (tests skip gracefully)
⏭️ Next.js CI (Progressive)  ACTIVE (most jobs skip in Phase 1-2)
⏭️ API Tests                 STANDBY (waits for Phase 3)
```

**Success Rate:** 100% (all workflows pass or skip gracefully)

#### 📖 Documentation

**Complete workflow guide:**
```
cat .github/workflows/README.md
```

This comprehensive guide explains:
- Each workflow's purpose and design
- When workflows activate
- Phase-by-phase activation timeline
- Troubleshooting guide
- Maintenance procedures

💡 **AUTOMATION WIN:** No manual workflow setup needed! Everything is pre-configured and ready for Phase 3!

---

☐ STEP 1: Verify CI/CD Status (10 minutes)

Go to: GitHub.com → Your repo → "Actions" tab

Expected results:
- ✅ All workflows passing or skipping gracefully
- ✅ No red X failures
- ✅ Informative skip messages explaining Phase 1-2 status

Verify workflows:
```bash
# List all workflow files
ls -la .github/workflows/

# Read the workflow guide
cat .github/workflows/README.md
```

☐ STEP 2: Understand Progressive Activation (10 minutes)

**Key Concept:** Workflows progressively activate as you build in Phase 3

**Example: Next.js CI Progressive Activation**
```
Phase 1-2 (Now):
- check-project-status: ✅ Runs (detects Phase 1-2)
- build/type-check/test: ⏭️ Skip (prerequisites missing)

Phase 3 (After creating next.config.js):
- check-project-status: ✅ Runs
- build: ✅ Activates automatically
- type-check: ✅ Activates automatically
- test: ⏭️ Skips (no test files yet)

Phase 3 (After adding test files):
- ALL JOBS: ✅ Activate automatically
```

**No manual changes needed - CI detects and activates!**

✅ CHECKPOINT: CI/CD system understood and verified

💡 BEGINNER TIP: The CI/CD system is already optimized for autonomous development with Aider!

### MILESTONE 2.2: GitHub Secrets Configuration (30 minutes)

**What:** Store sensitive credentials securely
**Why:** Never commit secrets to code!

☐ STEP 1: Navigate to Secrets (5 minutes)
   Go to: GitHub.com → Your repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

☐ STEP 2: Generate NextAuth Secret (5 minutes)
   Run locally:
   ```
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

   | DATABASE_URL | postgresql://temp:temp@localhost/temp | Temporary (will update) |
   | MT5_API_KEY | temp-key-123 | Temporary (will update) |
   | ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | [your MiniMax key] | For Aider in CI |
   | ANTHROPIC_API_BASE | https://api.minimaxi.com/v1 | MiniMax endpoint |

☐ STEP 4: Verify Secrets (5 minutes)
   Check: All 5 secrets show in list (values hidden) ✓

✅ CHECKPOINT: Secrets configured

💡 BEGINNER TIP: Never put real passwords in code! Always use secrets.

### 🚨 MILESTONE 2.3: Railway PostgreSQL Setup (1.5 hours)

**What:** Deploy database to cloud NOW (Week 2!)
**Why:** Test database setup early, prevent migration hell later

💡 CRITICAL: This is why V7 is better - database deployed early!

☐ STEP 1: Create Railway Account (10 minutes)
   1. Go to railway.app
   2. Click "Login" → "Login with GitHub"
   3. Authorize Railway
   4. Verify email

☐ STEP 2: Create Project (10 minutes)
   1. Click "New Project"
   2. Select "Provision PostgreSQL"
   3. Project name: "trading-alerts-saas-v7"
   4. Region: Choose closest to you
   5. Click "Deploy"
   
   Wait: PostgreSQL provisions (2-3 minutes)

☐ STEP 3: Get Database URL (10 minutes)
   1. Click PostgreSQL service
   2. Click "Connect" tab
   3. Find "DATABASE_URL"
   4. Copy entire URL (starts with postgresql://)
   5. Save it! 📝

☐ STEP 4: Test Connection Locally (15 minutes)
   
   Install pg library temporarily:
   ```
   npm install pg
   ```
   
   Create test file: `test-db-connection.js`
   ```javascript
   const { Client } = require('pg');
   
   const connectionString = 'YOUR_RAILWAY_DATABASE_URL_HERE';
   
   const client = new Client({ connectionString });
   
   client.connect()
     .then(() => {
       console.log('✅ Connected to Railway PostgreSQL!');
       return client.end();
     })
     .catch(err => {
       console.error('❌ Connection failed:', err.message);
     });
   ```
   
   Replace YOUR_RAILWAY_DATABASE_URL_HERE with your actual URL
   
   Run:
   ```
   node test-db-connection.js
   ```
   
   Expected: "✅ Connected to Railway PostgreSQL!"
   
   If connected ✓ → Success! Delete test file:
   ```
   rm test-db-connection.js
   ```

☐ STEP 5: Update GitHub Secret (5 minutes)
   GitHub → Settings → Secrets → DATABASE_URL → Edit
   
   Replace with your Railway URL

☐ STEP 6: Save Connection Info (5 minutes)

   ```markdown
   # Railway Connection Info
   
   ## PostgreSQL
   - Project: trading-alerts-saas-v7
   - Region: [your region]
   - DATABASE_URL: [your url - KEEP PRIVATE!]
   
   ## Dashboard
   - URL: railway.app/project/[your-project-id]
   
   ## Notes
   - Deployed: [date]
   - Plan: Free tier (5GB storage, $5 credit)
   ```
   
   ⚠️ DON'T commit this file! It's just for your reference.

✅ CHECKPOINT: Railway PostgreSQL deployed and tested!

💡 BEGINNER VICTORY: Your database is live in Week 2! When you build your app 
in Phase 3, you'll test on this production-like database immediately. No surprises later!

---

### MILESTONE 2.4: Prisma Workflow Understanding (30 minutes)

**What:** Learn how database migrations work
**Why:** You'll do this in Phase 3, understand it now

💡 BEGINNER TIP: Prisma = tool that talks to PostgreSQL for you. You write 
schema, Prisma creates tables.

☐ STEP 1: Read About Prisma (15 minutes)

Ask Claude Chat (me!):

```
Explain Prisma workflow for a complete beginner.

Cover:
1. What is Prisma? (simple explanation)
2. What is prisma/schema.prisma?
3. What are migrations?
4. The workflow: schema → migrate → deploy
5. Local vs Railway migrations
6. Why test on Railway early

Use simple language and analogies!
```

Read my explanation carefully. Ask questions if unclear!

☐ STEP 2: Understand The Workflow (15 minutes)

**The Process (you'll do this in Phase 3):**

```
STEP 1: Write Schema
Create: prisma/schema.prisma
Define: User table, Alert table, etc.

STEP 2: Test Locally
Run: npx prisma migrate dev --name init_users
Result: Creates tables in local PostgreSQL

STEP 3: Test on Railway (CRITICAL!)
Run: DATABASE_URL=[Railway] npx prisma migrate deploy
Result: Creates same tables on Railway

STEP 4: Verify Both
Local: npx prisma studio (opens GUI)
Railway: DATABASE_URL=[Railway] npx prisma studio
Result: See tables in both databases

STEP 5: Continue Building
Both databases now have same structure!
```

💡 KEY INSIGHT: Test on Railway IMMEDIATELY after local test. Don't wait!

✅ CHECKPOINT: Understand Prisma workflow

💡 BEGINNER NOTE: You'll execute this in Phase 3 with Aider. For now, just 
understand the concept!

---

### MILESTONE 2.5: Docker Configuration (1 hour)

**What:** Container setup for Flask service
**Why:** Package Flask for deployment

💡 BEGINNER TIP: Docker is OPTIONAL for local development!
   - Local dev: Run Flask with `python run.py`
   - Production: Docker required for Railway deployment
   
   You can develop the Flask service without Docker, then
   containerize it when ready to deploy.

☐ STEP 1: Start Aider (2 minutes)
   ```
   py -3.11 -m aider --model anthropic/MiniMax-M2
   ```

☐ STEP 2: Create Dockerfile for Flask (25 minutes)

You:
```
Create Dockerfile for Flask MT5 service

Location: mt5-service/Dockerfile

Requirements:
- Python 3.11-slim base image
- Install MT5 Linux libraries
- Install Python dependencies from requirements.txt
- Copy application code
- Expose port 5001
- Use gunicorn for production
- Follow Docker best practices from policies

Show me complete Dockerfile for approval.
```

Aider generates → Review → Approve → Creates

☐ STEP 3: Create docker-compose.yml (25 minutes)

You:
```
Create docker-compose.yml for local development

Requirements:
- PostgreSQL service (matches Railway)
- Flask MT5 service
- Proper networking
- Volume mounts for development
- Environment variables
- Follow best practices

Show me complete docker-compose.yml for approval.
```

☐ STEP 4: Test Docker Build (10 minutes)

   Exit Aider: `/exit`
   
   OPTIONAL - Try building (will fail - no requirements.txt yet, that's OK!):
cd mt5-service docker build -t mt5-service.


Expected: Error about missing files - normal!

💡 BEGINNER NOTE: 
   You DON'T need Docker working now for local development.
   
   Local development: Just run `python run.py`
   
   Docker is required LATER for Railway deployment in Phase 4.

✅ CHECKPOINT: Docker files ready for Phase 4 deployment

💡 BEGINNER TIP: You'll test this properly in Phase 3 when Flask code exists!

---

### MILESTONE 2.6: Testing Framework Setup (30 minutes)

**What:** Prepare testing tools
**Why:** Test as you build!

☐ STEP 1: Start Aider (2 minutes)
   ```
   py -3.11 -m aider --model anthropic/MiniMax-M2
   ```

☐ STEP 2: Setup Jest (25 minutes)

You:
```
Set up Jest testing framework for Next.js 15

Requirements:
- Install jest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom
- Create jest.config.js for Next.js 15
- Create jest.setup.js
- Create example test: __tests__/example.test.ts
- Add test scripts to package.json
- Follow testing strategy from policies

Show me all files for approval.
```

Aider generates all files → Review → Approve → Creates

☐ STEP 3: Commit (3 minutes)

Exit: `/exit`

```
git add .
git commit -m "Setup Jest testing framework"
git push
```

✅ CHECKPOINT: Testing ready
