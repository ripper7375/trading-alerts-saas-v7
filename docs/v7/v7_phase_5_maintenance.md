## PHASE 5: ONGOING DEVELOPMENT & MAINTENANCE
### Timeline: Continuous
### Goal: Improve, maintain, and scale

💡 BEGINNER TIP: Your V7 system with MiniMax M2 continues to help! 
Use Aider for all future changes.

---

### FOR NEW FEATURES:

**Example: Add email notifications when alerts trigger**

```bash
py -3.11 -m aider --model anthropic/MiniMax-M2

"Add feature: Email notifications when alerts trigger

Requirements:
- Send email via Resend API when alert price reached
- Email template with alert details
- User preference for email frequency (immediate, hourly, daily)
- Follow all policies

Show implementation plan first."
```

Aider will:
1. Plan the feature
2. Show you the plan
3. You approve
4. Aider implements autonomously with MiniMax M2
5. Escalates if needed
6. You test
7. Deploy!

---

### FOR BUG FIXES:

**Example: Fix tier validation bug**

```bash
py -3.11 -m aider --model anthropic/MiniMax-M2

"Bug: FREE tier users can access EURUSD charts

Expected: Should get 403 Forbidden
Actual: Can view EURUSD charts

File: app/api/charts/[symbol]/route.ts

Investigate and fix following security policies."
```

Aider will:
1. Analyze the code
2. Find the bug
3. Fix it
4. Validate the fix
5. Commit
6. You test and deploy

💡 BEGINNER TIP: MiniMax M2 handles both new features and bug fixes efficiently at lower cost!

---

### FOR POLICY UPDATES:

As you encounter new scenarios, update policies:

**Example: New architectural decision**

```markdown
# Add to docs/policies/03-architecture-rules.md

## Email Notification Patterns

**When alerts trigger:**
- Use job queue (not immediate API calls)
- Implement: lib/jobs/email-notifications.ts
- Queue emails with Bull or Inngest
- Process asynchronously
- Retry failed sends (max 3 attempts)

**Why:**
- Don't block API responses
- Handle email service outages gracefully
- Scale better under load
```

Commit the update:
```bash
git add docs/policies/03-architecture-rules.md
git commit -m "Add email notification architectural pattern"
git push
```

Next time Aider builds an email feature, it automatically follows this pattern!
