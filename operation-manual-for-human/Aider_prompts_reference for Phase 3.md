---

## 📌 Validation Workflow (NEW - 2025-11-26)

### **After Each File Generated:**

Aider should automatically:

1. Generate code following quality gates
2. (Optional) Run `npm run validate` if uncertain
3. Auto-approve if all checks pass
4. Auto-fix with `npm run fix` if minor issues
5. Escalate if critical issues found

### **After Each Part Complete:**

YOU must manually run:

```bash
npm run validate
```

If it fails:

```bash
npm run fix       # Auto-fix
npm run validate  # Verify fixed
```

### **Before Git Push:**

Pre-push hook will automatically:

- Run TypeScript type checking
- Run quick Jest tests
- Block push if failures

This is GOOD - it prevents CI/CD failures!

### **Validation Commands Quick Reference:**

| Command                   | What It Does           | When to Use       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| `npm run validate`        | All checks             | After each part   |
| `npm run validate:types`  | TypeScript only        | Debug type errors |
| `npm run validate:lint`   | ESLint only            | Debug lint errors |
| `npm run validate:format` | Prettier only          | Check formatting  |
| `npm run fix`             | Auto-fix lint + format | Fix minor issues  |
| `npm test`                | Run all tests          | Before final push |

---

## 📌 When Aider Asks for Clarification

```
Follow the build order specification exactly as written in part-0X-[name].md.

If something is ambiguous:
1. Check the implementation guide (v5_part_[letter].md)
2. Check the coding patterns (05-coding-patterns-compress.md)
3. If still unclear, escalate to me with specific question

Proceed with your best interpretation based on policies.
```

---

## 📌 When Aider Escalates

**Option 1: Approve**

```
Approved. Proceed with this implementation.
```

**Option 2: Changes Needed**

```
Make this change: [specific instruction]. Then proceed.
```

**Option 3: Major Issue**

```
Stop. Let me review the requirements. [Provide guidance]
```

---

## 📌 Resuming After Break

```
Resume Part [X] from where we left off.

Last completed: File [N]/[Total]
Next: File [N+1]/[Total]: [filename]

Continue following the build order.
```

---

## 📌 Verification After Part Complete

```
Run verification tests for Part [X]:

1. TypeScript: npx tsc --noEmit
2. Linting: pnpm lint
3. Build: pnpm build (if applicable)
4. Manual checks as specified in part-0X-[name].md

Report results and any issues found.
```

---

## 📌 If Something Goes Wrong

```
Stop current work.

Issue: [describe the problem]

Check these:
1. Are all dependencies met? (previous parts complete?)
2. Does the code follow the correct pattern?
3. Does it validate against policies?

Analyze the issue and provide a fix proposal.
If you cannot fix it, escalate with detailed explanation.
```

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL REMINDERS

### **✅ ALWAYS DO:**

- Use `/read-only` for build order files (NOT `/add`)
- Load implementation guides with `/read-only`
- Let Aider complete each file without interruption
- Trust the validation process
- Check progress reports

### **❌ NEVER DO:**

- Use `/add` for build orders (they become editable!)
- Interrupt Aider mid-file
- Skip verification tests
- Override build order without reason
- Panic when Aider escalates (it's designed to escalate)

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: "Cannot find v5_part_X.md"**

**Symptoms:**

- Aider says it cannot find an implementation guide
- Error: "File not found: docs/implementation-guides/v5_part_k.md"

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check if all 18 guides exist
cd docs/implementation-guides
ls -1 v5_part_{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,r,s}.md | wc -l
# Should return: 18

# If any are missing, check the audit report
# All guides were created on 2025-11-21 and should exist
```

**All 18 guides now exist:**

- Parts 1-10: v5_part_a.md through v5_part_j.md ✅
- Parts 11-16: v5_part_k.md through v5_part_p.md ✅
- Part 17: v5_part_r.md ✅
- Part 18: v5_part_s.md ✅

### **Issue: Token limit exceeded**

**Solution:**

```bash
# Drop unused files
/drop docs/build-orders/part-XX-previous.md
/drop docs/implementation-guides/v5_part_previous.md

# Clear conversation if needed
/clear
```

### **Issue: Aider doesn't load policy files**

**Solution:**

```bash
# Verify .aider.conf.yml exists in project root
ls -la .aider.conf.yml

# Restart Aider to reload configuration
# Exit and start again with start-aider-anthropic.bat
```

| Base Load      | 147k            | Always loaded (policies + quality) |
| + Part Files   | +6-28k          | Varies by part (see table below)   |
| + Conversation | +20-30k         | Grows during build session         |
| **Safe Limit** | 190k            | Stay below this                    |
| **Max Limit**  | 204.8k          | Context overflow (MiniMax M2)      |

### Token Load by Part:

| Part    | Files | Docs Load | Total Usage | Margin | Status        |
| ------- | ----- | --------- | ----------- | ------ | ------------- |
| 1-16    | 4-25  | 6-13k     | 170-185k    | 20-35k | ✅ Safe       |
| **17A** | 32    | 14k       | ~186k       | 18.8k  | ⚠️ Tight      |
| **17B** | 35    | 12k       | ~184k       | 20.8k  | ⚠️ Tight      |
| **18**  | 37    | 28k       | ~200k       | 4.8k   | 🚨 Very Tight |

**If approaching 190k tokens:**

- Drop previous part files
- Clear conversation: `/clear`
- Keep responses brief during escalations
- Restart Aider if needed

**Part 17A & 17B were split to prevent overflow - build them sequentially!**
**Part 18 is tight - keep conversations concise, commit frequently.**
