Do I Need to Test Validation Before Starting?
Short Answer: No full testing needed - just a quick understanding!

What You Should Do:
✅ Read VALIDATION-SETUP-GUIDE.md (5 minutes)

Understand what npm run validate does
Learn the 3 outcomes: Approve/Fix/Escalate
Know when to use npm run fix
✅ Quick Test (1 minute)

# Just run this once to see it works:
npm run validate

# Expected: Will show validation errors since no code built yet
# That's OK! You just want to see the command works
✅ That's it! You're ready for Phase 3

Why You Don't Need Extensive Testing:
✅ System already configured and tested by me
✅ Aider will run validation automatically after each file
✅ You'll learn by doing during Phase 3
✅ Validation happens ~170 times (plenty of practice!)
