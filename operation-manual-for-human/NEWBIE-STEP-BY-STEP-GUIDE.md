---

## 🎬 SECTION 1: BEFORE STARTING PHASE 3

**Goal:** Ensure you're ready to build code
**Time:** 5 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Phase 2 complete ✅

### ☑️ CHECKLIST 1.1: Verify Phase 2 Completion

Run these commands to verify:

```bash
# 1. Check you're in the right directory
pwd
# Expected: /home/user/trading-alerts-saas-v7

# 2. Check git status (should be clean)
git status
# Expected: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

# 3. Verify all policy files exist
ls docs/policies/
# Expected: See 00-tier-specifications.md through 08-google-oauth...

# 4. Verify all build-order files exist
ls docs/build-orders/
# Expected: See part-01-foundation.md through part-16-utilities.md,
#           part-17a-affiliate-portal.md, part-17b-admin-automation.md, part-18-dlocal.md
#           (19 build order files total)

# 5. Verify Aider configuration exists
ls .aider.conf.yml
# Expected: File exists

# 6. Check implementation guides exist
ls docs/implementation-guides/ | wc -l
# Expected: 18 files (v5_part_a.md through v5_part_s.md)
```

**✅ All checks passed?** → Continue to Checklist 1.2
**❌ Any check failed?** → Review Phase 2 documentation

---

### ☑️ CHECKLIST 1.2: Quick Validation Test (Optional)

**Purpose:** Understand what validation does (1 minute)

```bash
# Run validation once to see it works
npm run validate
```

**Expected output:**
```
🔍 Checking TypeScript types...
⚠️ Some errors (this is OK - no code built yet)
```

**✅ Command ran?** → You're ready for Phase 3!

**Note:** You DON'T need to fix these errors. They're expected because you haven't built any code yet. This was just to verify the command works.

---

### ☑️ CHECKLIST 1.3: Read Essential Documents (5 minutes)

Before starting, quickly skim these:

1. **Aider Operation Guide** - How to use Aider
   📄 `operation-manual-for-human/Aider-Operation-Guide for Phase 3.md`

2. **Aider Autonomous Behavior** - What Aider does automatically
   📄 `operation-manual-for-human/Aider Autonomous Behavior in Phase 3.md`

3. **Complete Verification Guide** - When YOU need to verify
   📄 `operation-manual-for-human/complete_verification_guide for Phase 3.md`

**✅ Documents reviewed?** → You're ready to start Phase 3!

---

## 🚀 SECTION 2: DURING PHASE 3 (Building Code)

**Goal:** Build all 19 build sessions (274 files: 170 core + 67 affiliate + 37 dLocal)
**Time:** 60 hours (mostly Aider working autonomously)
**Your Active Time:** 8-10 hours (build session transitions + verifications)

---

### 🔄 THE STANDARD WORKFLOW (Repeat for Each Build Session)

**You'll do this 19 times (once per build session - Parts 1-16, 17A, 17B, 18):**

#### Step 1: Start Aider (if not running)

```bash
# Run Aider startup script
start-aider-anthropic.bat
```

**Wait for:**
```
Aider v0.86.1
Model: openai/MiniMax-M2
>
```

---

#### Step 2: Load Part Files (Read-Only)

**CRITICAL:** Use `/read-only` NOT `/add`

```bash
# For Part 1 example:
/read-only docs/build-orders/part-01-foundation.md
/read-only docs/implementation-guides/v5_part_a.md
```

**Expected:**
```
Added docs\build-orders\part-01-foundation.md to the chat (read-only)
Added docs\implementation-guides\v5_part_a.md to the chat (read-only)
```

---

#### Step 3: Give Build Command

**Copy this template and customize for each part:**

```
Build Part [NUMBER]: [PART NAME]

Follow the build order in part-[XX]-[name].md exactly.

Requirements:
- Build all [N] files in sequence
- Use patterns from 05-coding-patterns-compress.md
- Validate against all policies
- Auto-commit each file if approved
- Report progress after every 3 files

Start with File 1/[N]: [first-file-path]
```

**Example for Part 1:**
```
Build Part 1: Foundation & Root Configuration

Follow the build order in part-01-foundation.md exactly.

Requirements:
- Build all 12 files in sequence
- Use patterns from 05-coding-patterns-compress.md
- Validate against all policies
- Auto-commit each file if approved
- Report progress after every 3 files

Start with File 1/12: .vscode/settings.json
```

---

#### Step 4: Let Aider Work Autonomously

**Aider will now:**
- ✅ Generate code for each file
- ✅ Run validation automatically
- ✅ Auto-commit approved files
- ✅ Report progress every 3 files
- ✅ Stop only for: (1) Escalations or (2) Part completion

**What you do:**
- ☕ Take a break (seriously!)
- 👀 Check progress reports (optional)
- 📧 Wait for escalations (if any)

**Aider will display progress like:**
```
Progress Report:
✅ File 1/12: .vscode/settings.json - Completed
✅ File 2/12: .vscode/extensions.json - Completed
✅ File 3/12: next.config.js - Completed

Next: File 4/12: tailwind.config.ts
```

---

#### Step 5: Handle Escalations (If They Occur)

**Aider stops and asks for help (~2% of files)**

**Example escalation:**
```
⚠️ ESCALATION REQUIRED

Issue Type: Dependency Decision
File: package.json
Question: Should I use version X or Y of library Z?

Awaiting human decision...
```

**How to respond:**

**Option 1 - Approve:**
```
Approved. Proceed with this implementation.
```

**Option 2 - Give specific guidance:**
```
Make this change: [your instruction]. Then proceed.
```

**Option 3 - Stop to review:**
```
Stop. Let me review the requirements. [provide more context]
```

**After you respond:** Aider continues autonomously

---

#### Step 6: Wait for Part Completion

**Aider finishes and displays:**
```
🎉 Part [X] Complete!

Summary:
✅ All [N] files built
✅ All files committed
✅ No escalations needed (or: 2 escalations handled)
✅ Token usage: 175k/204k

Ready for verification tests.
```

**Aider STOPS here** → Waiting for your next command

---

#### Step 7: Run Manual Verification

**Now YOU verify the part is working properly**

See **"Verification Checkpoints"** section below for specific tests per part.

---

#### Step 8: Rotate to Next Part

**After verification passes:**

```bash
# Drop previous part files
/drop docs/build-orders/part-[XX]-[previous].md
/drop docs/implementation-guides/v5_part_[previous].md

# Load next part files
/read-only docs/build-orders/part-[XX]-[next].md
/read-only docs/implementation-guides/v5_part_[next].md
```

**Then:** Repeat from Step 3 for the new part
