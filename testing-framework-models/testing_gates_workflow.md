- [ ] Code follows coding standards
- [ ] Basic functionality working

### **GATE 1: LOCAL → DEVELOPMENT**

#### Required Tests (Must Pass All)
- [ ] **Unit Tests** (90%+ coverage)
  - Individual function/method tests
  - Mock external dependencies
  - Test edge cases and error handling

- [ ] **Linting/Code Quality** 
  - ESLint, Prettier, or similar tools
  - Code style consistency
  - No critical security warnings

- [ ] **Component Tests**
  - UI component functionality
  - Component integration tests
  - Snapshot testing (if applicable)

- [ ] **Basic Functionality Tests**
  - Core feature works as intended
  - No obvious bugs or crashes
  - Happy path validation

- [ ] **Code Review Approval**
  - Peer review completed
  - Architecture approval
  - Security review (if needed)

#### Promotion Trigger
✅ **ALL tests pass + Code review approved**
