     Q2: "What happens after the 7-day trial?"
     A: "After your 7-day Pro trial ends, you'll be automatically charged ${isYearly ? "$290/year" : "$29/month"} unless you cancel before the trial period expires. You can cancel anytime during the trial with no charges."

     Q3: "Do you offer refunds?"

     A: "When you use an affiliate referral code during checkout, you'll receive 20% off that month's PRO subscription payment (price drops from $29 to $23.20). This is a one-time discount per code. To get the discount again next month, you'll need to find and apply a new code during renewal. Affiliates post fresh codes on social media monthly!"

export default function PricingPage() {
  const [isYearly, setIsYearly] = useState(false)
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()
  const affiliateCode = searchParams.get('ref') // Get ?ref=CODE from URL

  // Price calculation
  const proMonthlyPrice = affiliateCode ? 23.20 : 29.00
  const proYearlyPrice = affiliateCode ? 232.00 : 290.00
  const monthlySavings = affiliateCode ? 5.80 : 0
