  notifications: z.object({
    email: z.boolean(),
    push: z.boolean(),
    sms: z.boolean()
  }).refine(data => data.email || data.push || data.sms, {

Button: [Upgrade to PRO] [Manage Existing Alerts]
If symbol/timeframe not in tier:
Show error: "🔒 This symbol/timeframe requires PRO tier"
Button: [Upgrade to PRO]
Network errors:
Show toast notification: "Failed to create alert. Please try again."
Keep modal open with form data intact

9. RESPONSIVE:

Tablet: max-w-lg, full padding
Mobile: Full screen modal (h-screen, overflow-scroll)
Header sticky at top

10. TECHNICAL:

Export as default component
TypeScript with proper types
Props: isOpen (boolean), onClose (function), prefilledData (object with symbol, timeframe, targetLine from chart click), userTier ('FREE' | 'PRO'), currentAlertCount (number)
Use React Hook Form for form management
Use Zod for validation
Use shadcn/ui Dialog, Button, RadioGroup, Checkbox, Slider, Select components
State for: form data, loading, success, errors
Mock onSubmit handler that simulates API call


Generate complete, production-ready code with all imports and mock data that I can copy and run immediately.
