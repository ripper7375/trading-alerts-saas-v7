DESIGN NOTES:
- Use gradient card for current plan to make it stand out
- Progress bars use semantic colors: green (healthy), blue (normal), yellow/orange (warning)
- Consistent spacing: mb-12 between major sections, mb-6 for section headings
- All cards use rounded-xl and shadow-lg
- Responsive: stack grids to 1 column on mobile

TECHNICAL:
- Export as default component
- TypeScript with props: tier ('FREE' | 'PRO'), subscriptionStatus ('active' | 'trial' | 'canceled')
- Use shadcn/ui: Card, Button, Badge, Progress, Table
- Mock data included
- Make interactive (buttons should have onClick handlers with console.log)

Generate complete, production-ready code with all sections that I can copy and run immediately.
